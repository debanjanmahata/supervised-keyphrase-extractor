of alternative out * This work was supported in part by NSF grant CCR9988526 .\u2020 This work was supported in part by NSF grant CCR9988526 and DIMACS .comes based on the individual preferences of a set P of players .A method for aggregating player preferences to select one outcome is called a social choice function .In this paper we assume that the range A is finite and that each player 's preference is expressed by a valuation function which assigns to each possible outcome a real number representing the `` benefit '' the player derives from that outcome .The ensemble of player valuation functions is viewed as a valuation matrix with rows indexed by players and columns by outcomes .A major difficulty connected with social choice functions is that players can not be required to tell the truth about their preferences .Since each player seeks to maximize his own benefit , he may find it in his interest to misrepresent his valuation function .An important approach for dealing with this problem is to augment a given social choice function with a payment function , which assigns to each player a positive or negative payment as a function of all of the individual preferences .By carefully choosing the payment function , one can hope to entice each player to tell the truth .A social choice function augmented with a payment function is called a mechanism 1 and the mechanism is said to implement the social choice function .A mechanism is truthful or to be strategyproof or to have a dominant strategy if each player 's best strategy , knowing the preferences of the others , is always to declare his own true preferences .A social choice function is truthfully implementable , or truthful if it has a truthful implementation .The property of truthful implementability is sometimes called dominant strategy incentive compatibility .This framework leads naturally to the question : which social choice functions are truthful ?This question is of the following general type : given a class of functions here , social choice functions and a property that holds for some of them here , truthfulness , `` characterize '' the property .The definition of the property itself provides a characterization , so what more is needed ?Here are some useful notions of characterization :family has the property , and that every function with the property is in the family .A third notion applies in the case of hereditary properties of functions .A function g is a subfunction of function f , or f contains g , if g is obtained by restricting the domain of f .A property P of functions is hereditary if it is preserved under taking subfunctions .Truthfulness is easily seen to be hereditary .We are not aware of any work on recognition algorithms for the property of truthfulness , but there are significant results concerning parametric representations and obstruction characterizations of truthfulness .It turns out that the domain of the function , i.e. , the set of allowed valuation matrices , is crucial .For functions with unrestricted domain , i.e. , whose domain is the set of all real matrices , there are very good characterizations of truthfulness .For general domains , however , the picture is far from complete .Typically , the domains of social choice functions are specified by a system of constraints .For example , an order constraint requires that one specified entry in some row be larger than another in the same row , a range constraint places an upper or lower bound on an entry , and a zero constraint forces an entry to be 0 .These are all examples of linear inequality constraints on the matrix entries .Building on work of Roberts 10 , Lavi , Mu'alem and Nisan 6 defined a condition called weak monotonicity WMON .Independently , in the context of multi-unit auctions , Bikhchandani , Chatterji and Sen 3 identified the same condition and called it nondecreasing in marginal utilities NDMU .The definition of W-MON can be formulated in terms of obstructions : for some specified simple set F of functions each having domains of size 2 , a function satisfies W-MON if it contains no function from F .The functions in F are not truthful , and therefore W-MON is a necessary condition for truthfulness .Lavi , Mu'alem and Nisan 6 showed that W-MON is also sufficient for truthfulness for social choice functions whose domain is order-based , i.e. , defined by order constraints and zero constraints , and Gui , Muller and Vohra 5 extended this to other domains .The domain constraints considered in both papers are special cases of linear inequality constraints , and it is natural to ask whether W-MON is sufficient for any domain defined by such constraints .Lavi , Mu'alem and Nisan 6 conjectured that W-MON suffices for convex domains .The main result of this paper is an affirmative answer to this conjecture :Using the interpretation of weak monotonicity in terms of obstructions each having domain size 2 , this provides a complete set of minimal obstructions for truthfulness within the class of social choice functions with convex domains .The two hypotheses on the social choice function , that the domain is convex and that the range is finite , can not be omitted as is shown by the examples given in section 7 .There is a simple and natural parametrized set of truthful social choice functions called affine maximizers .Roberts 10 showed that for functions with unrestricted domain , every truthful function is an affine maximizer , thus providing a parametrized representation for truthful functions with unrestricted domain .There are many known examples of truthful functions over restricted domains that are not affine maximizers see 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 and 7 .Each of these examples has a special structure and it seems plausible that there might be some mild restrictions on the class of all social choice functions such that all truthful functions obeying these restrictions are affine maximizers .Lavi , Mu'alem and Nisan 6 obtained a result in this direction by showing that for order-based domains , under certain technical assumptions , every truthful social choice function is `` almost '' an affine maximizer .There are a number of results about truthfulness that can be viewed as providing obstruction characterizations , although the notion of obstruction is not explicitly discussed .For a player i , a set of valuation matrices is said to be i-local if all of the matrices in the set are identical except for row i. Call a social choice function i-local if its domain is ilocal and call it local if it is i-local for some i .The following easily proved fact is used extensively in the literature :This implies that the set of all local non-truthful functions comprises a complete set of obstructions for truthfulness .This set is much smaller than the set of all non-truthful functions , but is still far from a minimal set of obstructions .Rochet 11 , Rozenshtrom 12 and Gui , Muller and Vohra 5 identified a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness see lemma 3 below called the nonnegative cycle property .This condition can be viewed as providing a minimal complete set of non-truthful functions .As is required by proposition 2 , each function in the set is local .Furthermore it is one-to-one .In particular its domain has size at most the number of possible outcomes | A | .As this complete set of obstructions consists of minimal non-truthful functions , this provides the optimal obstruction characterization of non-truthful functions within the class of all social choice functions .But by restricting attention to interesting subclasses of social choice functions , one may hope to get simpler sets of obstructions for truthfulness within that class .The condition of weak monotonicity mentioned earlier can be defined by a set of obstructions , each of which is a local function of domain size exactly 2 .Thus the results of Lavi , Mu'alem and Nisan 6 , and of Gui , Muller and Vohra 5 give a very simple set of obstructions for truthfulness within certain subclasses of social choice functions .Theorem 1 extends these results to a much larger subclass of functions .By proposition 2 , a function is truthful if and only if each of its local subfunctions is truthful .Therefore , to get a set of obstructions for truthfulness , it suffices to obtain such a set for local functions .The domain of an i-local function consists of matrices that are fixed on all rows but row i. Fix such a function f and let D \u2286 RA be the set of allowed choices for row i .Since f depends only on row i and row i is chosen from D , we can view f as a function from D to A. Therefore , f is a social choice function having one player ; we refer to such a function as a single player function .Associated to any single player function f with domain D we define an edge-weighted directed graph Hf whose vertex set is the image of f. For convenience , we assume that f is surjective and so this image is A. For each a , b \u2208 A , x \u2208 f -1 a there is an edge ex a , b from a to b with weight x a \u2212 x b .The weight of a set of edges is just the sum of the weights of the edges .We say that f satisfies :We say a local function g satisfies nonnegative cycle property/nonnegative two-cycle property if its associated single player function f does .The graph Hf has a possibly infinite number of edges between any two vertices .We define Gf to be the edgeweighted directed graph with exactly one edge from a to b , whose weight \u03b4ab is the infimum possibly \u2212 \u221e of all of the edge weights ex a , b for x \u2208 f -1 a .It is easy to see that Hf has the nonnegative cycle property/nonnegative two-cycle property if and only if Gf does .Gf is called the outcome graph of f .The weak monotonicity property mentioned earlier can be defined for arbitrary social choice functions by the condition that every local subfunction satisfies the nonnegative two-cycle property .The following result was obtained by Rochet 11 in a slightly different form and rediscovered by Rozenshtrom 12 and Gui , Muller and Vohra 5 : LEMMA 3 .A local social choice function is truthful if and only if it has the nonnegative cycle property .Thus a social choice function is truthful if and only if every local subfunction satisfies the nonnegative cycle property .In light of this , theorem 1 follows from : THEOREM 4 .For any surjective single player function f : D \u2212 \u2192 A where D is a convex subset of RA and A is finite , the nonnegative two-cycle property implies the nonnegative cycle property .This is the result we will prove .Let D \u2286 RA be convex and let f : D \u2212 \u2192 A be a single player function such that Gf has no negative two-cycles .We want to conclude that Gf has no negative cycles .For two vertices a , b , let \u03b4 \u2217 ab denote the minimum weight of any path from a to b. Clearly \u03b4 \u2217 ab \u2264 \u03b4ab .Our proof shows that the \u03b4 \u2217 weight of every cycle is exactly 0 , from which theorem 4 follows .There seems to be no direct way to compute \u03b4 \u2217 and so we proceed indirectly .Based on geometric considerations , we identify a subset of paths in Gf called admissible paths and a subset of admissible paths called straight paths .We prove that for any two outcomes a , b , there is a straight path from a to b lemma 8 and corollary 10 , and all straight paths from a to b have the same weight , which we denote \u03c1ab theorem 12 .We show that \u03c1ab \u2264 \u03b4ab lemma 14 and that the \u03c1-weight of every cycle is 0 .The key step to this proof is showing that the \u03c1-weight of every directed triangle is 0 lemma 17 .It turns out that \u03c1 is equal to \u03b4 \u2217 corollary 20 , although this equality is not needed in the proof of theorem 4 .To expand on the above summary , we give the definitions of an admissible path and a straight path .These are somewhat technical and rely on the geometry of f .We first observe that , without loss of generality , we can assume that D is topologically closed section 2 .In section 3 , for each a \u2208 A , we enlarge the set f-1 a to a closed convex set Da \u2286 D in such a way that for a , b \u2208 A with a = b , Da and Db have disjoint interiors .We define an admissible path to be a sequence of outcomes a1 , ... , ak such that each of the sets Ij = Daj \u2229 Daj +1 is nonempty section 4 .An admissible path is straight if there is a straight line that meets one point from each of the sets I1 , ... , Ik-1 in order section 5 .Finally , we mention how the hypotheses of convex domain and finite range are used in the proof .Both hypotheses are needed to show : 1 the existence of a straight path from a to b for all a , b lemma 8 .2 that the \u03c1-weight of a directed triangle is 0 lemma 17 .The convex domain hypothesis is also needed for the convexity of the sets Da section 3 .The finite range hypothesis is also needed to reduce theorem 4 to the case that D is closed section 2 and to prove that every straight path from a to b has the same \u03b4-weight theorem 12 .", "title": "Weak Monotonicity Suffices for Truthfulness on Convex Domains", "author_keywords_stem": ["dominant strategy", "mechanism design", "strategyproof", "truthful", "weak monotonicity"], "abstract": "Weak monotonicity is a simple necessary condition for a social choice function to be implementable by a truthful mechanism .Roberts 10 showed that it is sufficient for all social choice functions whose domain is unrestricted .Lavi , Mu'alem and Nisan 6 proved the sufficiency of weak monotonicity for functions over order-based domains and Gui , Muller and Vohra 5 proved sufficiency for order-based domains with range constraints and for domains defined by other special types of linear inequality constraints .Here we show the more general result , conjectured by Lavi , Mu'alem and Nisan 6 , that weak monotonicity is sufficient for functions defined on any convex domain .", "id": "J-62", "combined_keywords_stem": ["social choic function", "weak monoton", "convex domain", "individu prefer", "truth implement", "recognit algorithm", "nonneg cycl properti", "truth", "affin maxim", "non-truth function", "domin strategi", "mechan design", "strategyproof", "truth"], "combined_keywords": ["social choice function", "weak monotonicity", "convex domain", "individual preference", "truthful implementation", "recognition algorithm", "nonnegative cycle property", "truthfulness", "affine maximizer", "non-truthful function", "dominant strategy", "mechanism design", "strategyproof", "truthful"], "author_keywords": ["dominant strategy", "mechanism design", "strategyproof", "truthful", "weak monotonicity"], "method": "We first reduce the theorem to the case that D is closed .Write DC for the closure of D .Since A is finite , DC = \u222a aEA f-1 a C.

Extend f to the function g on DC by defining g v = a v for v \u2208 DC \u2212 D and g v = f v for v \u2208 D .It is easy to check that \u03b4ab g = \u03b4ab f for all a , b \u2208 A and therefore it suffices to show that the nonnegative two-cycle property for g implies the nonnegative cycle property for g.

Clearly , Da is closed and convex , and contains f \u2212 1 a .Therefore Sa \u2208 A Da = D. Also , by proposition 5 , any point v in Da n Db satisfies v a v b = \u03b4ab = \u03b4ba .A path of size k is a sequence \u2192 a = a1 , ... , ak with each ai E A possibly with repetition .We call \u2192 a an a1 , ak path .For a path \u2192 a , we write I \u2192 a I for the size of \u2192 a .\u2192 a is simple if the ai 's are distinct .For b , c E A we write Pbc for the set of b , c paths and SPbc for the set of simple b , c paths .The \u03b4-weight of path \u2192 a is defined by A D-sequence of order k is a sequence \u2192 u = u0 , ... , uk with each ui E D possibly with repetition .We call \u2192 u a u0 , uk sequence .For a D-sequence \u2192 u , we write ord u for the order of \u2192 u .For v , w E D we write Svw for the set of v , w sequences .A compatible pair is a pair \u2192 a , \u2192 u where \u2192 a is a path and \u2192 u is a D-sequence satisfying ord \u2192 u = I \u2192 a I and for each i E k , both ui \u2212 1 and ui belong to Dai .We write C \u2192 a for the set of D-sequences \u2192 u that are compatible with \u2192 a .We say that \u2192 a is admissible if C \u2192 a is nonempty .For \u2192 u E C \u2192 a we defineFor v , w E D and b , c E A , we define Cvw bc to be the set of compatible pairs \u2192 a , \u2192 u such that \u2192 a E Pbc and \u2192 u E Svw .To illustrate these definitions , figure 1 gives the dissection of a domain , a 2-dimensional plane , into five regions Da , Db , Dc , Dd , De .D-sequence v , w , x , y , z is compatible with both path a , b , c , e and path a , b , d , e ; D-sequence v , w , u , y , z is compatible with a unique path a , b , d , e .D-sequence x , w , p , y , z is compatible with a unique path b , a , d , e .Hence a , b , c , e , a , b , d , e and b , a , d , e are adNoticing both ui \u2212 1 and ui belong to Dai n Da , i , we have by proposition 5For v , w E D we write vw for the closed line segment joining v and w .A D-sequence \u2192 u of order k is linear provided that there is a sequence of real numbers 0 = \u03bb0 < \u03bb1 < ... < \u03bbk = 1 such that ui = 1 \u03bbi u0 + \u03bbiuk .In particular , each ui belongs to u0uk .For v , w E D we write Lvw for the set of linear v , w sequences .For b , c E A and v , w E D we write LCvw bc for the set of compatible pairs \u2192 a , \u2192 u such that \u2192 a E Pbc and \u2192 u E Lvw .For a path \u2192 a , we write L \u2192 a for the set of linear sequences compatible with \u2192 a .We say that \u2192 a is straight if L \u2192 a = 0 .For example , in figure 1 , D-sequence v , w , x , y , z is linear while v , w , u , y , z , x , w , p , y , z , and x , v , w , y , z are not .Hence path a , b , c , e and a , b , d , e are both straight .However , path b , a , d , e is not straight .LEMMA 8 .Let b , c \u2208 A and v \u2208 Db , w \u2208 Dc .There is a simple path \u2192 \u2212 a and D-sequence \u2192 \u2212 u such that \u2212 \u2192 a , \u2192 \u2212 u \u2208 LCvw bc .Furthermore , for any such path \u2192 \u2212 a , \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a \u2264 v b \u2212 v c .PROOF .By the convexity of D , any sequence of points on vw is a D-sequence .If b = c , singleton path \u2192 \u2212 a = b and D-sequence \u2192 \u2212 u = v , w are obviously compatible .\u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a = 0 = v b \u2212 v c .So assume b = c .If Db \u2229 Dc \u2229 vw = \u2205 , we pick an arbitrary x from this set and let \u2192 \u2212 a = b , c \u2208 SPbc , \u2192 \u2212 u = v , x , w \u2208 Lvw .Again it is easy to check the compatibility of \u2212 \u2192 a , \u2192 \u2212 u .Since v \u2208 Db , v b \u2212 v c \u2265 \u03b4bc = \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a .For the remaining case b = c and Db \u2229 Dc \u2229 vw = \u2205 , notice v = w otherwise v = w \u2208 Db \u2229 Dc \u2229 vw .So we can define \u03bbx for every point x on vw to be the unique number in 0 , 1 such that x = 1 \u2212 \u03bbx v + \u03bbxw .For convenience , we write x \u2264 y for \u03bbx \u2264 \u03bby .Let Ia = Da \u2229 vw for each a \u2208 A .Since D = \u222a a \u2208 ADa , we have vw = \u222a a \u2208 AIa .Moreover , by the convexity of Da and vw , Ia is a possibly trivial closed interval .We begin by considering the case that Ib and Ic are each a single point , that is , Ib = v and Ic = w .Let S be a minimal subset of A satisfying \u222a s \u2208 SIs = vw .For each s \u2208 S , Is is maximal , i.e. , not contained in any other It , for t \u2208 S .In particular , the intervals Is : s \u2208 S have all left endpoints distinct and all right endpoints distinct and the order of the left endpoints is the same as that of the right endpoints .Let k = | S | + 2 and index S as a2 , ... , ak \u2212 1 in the order defined by the right endpoints .Denote the interval Iai by li , ri .Thus l2 < l3 < ... < lk \u2212 1 , r2 < r3 < ... < rk \u2212 1 and the fact that these intervals cover vw implies l2 = v , rk \u2212 1 = w and for all 2 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 2 , li +1 \u2264 ri which further implies li < ri .Now we define the path \u2192 \u2212 a = a1 , a2 , ... , ak \u2212 1 , ak with a1 = b , ak = c and a2 , a3 , ... , ak \u2212 1 as above .Define the linear D-sequence \u2192 \u2212 u = u0 , u1 , ... , uk by u0 = u1 = v , uk = w and for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 1 , ui = ri .It follows immediately that \u2212 \u2192 a , \u2192 \u2212 u \u2208 LCvw bc .Neither b nor c is in S since lb = rb and lc = rc .Thus \u2192 \u2212 a is simple .Finally to show \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a \u2264 v b \u2212 v c , we notefde y .Therefore fde z is monotonically nonincreasing along \u2190 \u2192 the line xy as z moves in the direction from x to y. Applying this fact with d = ai , e = ai +1 , x = li and y = ri gives the desired conclusion .This completes the proof for the case that Ib = v and Ic = w .For general Ib , Ic , rb < lc otherwise Db \u2229 Dc \u2229 vw = Ib \u2229 Ic = \u2205 .Let v ~ = rb and w ~ = lc .Clearly we can apply the above conclusion to v ~ \u2208 Db , w ~ \u2208 Dc and get a compatible pair \u2212 \u2192 a , \u2192 \u2212 u ~ \u2208 LCv ~ w ~ bc with \u2192 \u2212 a simple and \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a \u2264 v ~ b \u2212 v ~ c .Define the linear D-sequence \u2192 \u2212 u by u0 = v , uk = w and ui = u ~ i for i \u2208 k \u2212 1 .\u2212 \u2192 a , \u2192 \u2212 u \u2208 LCvw bc is evident .Moreover , applying the above fact with d = b , e = c , x = v and y = w , we get v b \u2212 v c \u2265 v ~ b \u2212 v ~ c \u2265 \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a .The main result of this section theorem 12 says that for any b , c \u2208 A , every straight b , c path has the same \u03b4-weight .To prove this , we first fix v \u2208 Db and w \u2208 Dc and show lemma 11 that every straight b , c path compatible with some linear v , w sequence has the same \u03b4-weight \u03c1bc v , w .We then show in theorem 12 that \u03c1bc v , w is the same for all choices of v \u2208 Db and w \u2208 Dc .bc .It suffices to show \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a ~ = \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a ~ ~ .To do this we construct a linear v , w sequence \u2192 \u2212 u and paths \u2192 \u2212 a \u2217 , \u2192 \u2212 a \u2217 \u2217 \u2208 Pbc , both compatible with \u2192 \u2212 u , satisfying \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a \u2217 = \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a ~ and \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a \u2217 \u2217 = \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a ~ ~ .Lemma 7 implies \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a \u2217 = \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a \u2217 \u2217 , which will complete the proof .Let | \u2212 \u2192 a ~ | = ord \u2212 \u2192 u ~ = k and | \u2212 \u2192 a ~ ~ | = ord \u2212 \u2192 u ~ ~ = l .We select \u2192 \u2212 u to be any linear v , w sequence u0 , u1 , ... , ut such that \u2192 \u2212 u ~ and \u2192 \u2212 u ~ ~ are both subsequences of \u2192 \u2212 u , i.e. , there are indices 0 = i0 < i1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < ik = t and 0 = j0 < j1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < jl = t such that \u2192 \u2212 u ~ = ui0 , ui1 , ... , uik and \u2192 \u2212 u ~ ~ = uj0 , uj1 , ... , ujl .We now construct a b , c path \u2192 \u2212 a \u2217 compatible with \u2192 \u2212 u such that \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a \u2217 = \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a ~ .An analogous construction gives \u2192 \u2212 a \u2217 \u2217 compatible with \u2192 \u2212 u such that \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a \u2217 \u2217 = \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a ~ ~ .This will complete the proof .\u2192 \u2212 a \u2217 is defined as follows : for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 t , a \u2217 j = a ~ r where r is the unique index satisfying ir \u2212 1 < j \u2264 ir .Since bothWe are now ready for the main theorem of the section : THEOREM 12 .\u03c1bc is a constant map on Db \u00d7 Dc .Thus for any b , c \u2208 A , every straight b , c path has the same \u03b4weight .PROOF .For a path \u2192 \u2212 a , v , w is compatible with \u2192 \u2212 a if there is a linear v , w sequence compatible with \u2192 \u2212 a .We write CP \u2212 \u2192 a for the set of pairs v , w compatible with \u2192 \u2212 a .\u03c1bc is constant on CP \u2212 \u2192 a because for each v , w \u2208 CP \u2212 \u2192 a , \u03c1bc v , w = \u03b4 \u2212 \u2192 a .By lemma 8 , we also have S \u2212 \u2192 a \u2208 SPbc CP \u2212 \u2192 a = Db \u00d7 Dc .Since A is finite , SPbc , the set of simple paths from b to c , is finite as well .Next we prove that for any path \u2192 \u2212 a , CP \u2212 \u2192 a is closed .Let vn , wn : n \u2208 ICY be a convergent sequence in CP \u2212 \u2192 a and let v , w be the limit .We want to show that v , w \u2208 CP \u2212 \u2192 a .For each n \u2208 ICY , since vn , wn \u2208 CP \u2212 \u2192 a , there is a linear vn , wn sequence un compatible with \u2192 \u2212 a , i.e. , there are 0 = \u03bbn0 \u2264 \u03bbn1 \u2264 ... \u2264 \u03bbnk = 1 k = | \u2212 \u2192 a | such that unj = 1 \u2212 \u03bbnj vn + \u03bbnj wn j = 0 , 1 , ... , k .Since for each n , \u03bbn = \u03bbn0 , \u03bbn 1 , ... , \u03bbn k belongs to the closed bounded set 0 , 1 k +1 we can choose an infinite subset I \u2286 ICY such that the sequence \u03bbn : n \u2208 I converges .Let \u03bb = \u03bb0 , \u03bb1 , ... , \u03bbk be the limit .Clearly 0 = \u03bb0 \u2264 \u03bb1 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u03bbk = 1 .Define the linear v , w sequence \u2192 \u2212 u by uj = 1 \u2212 \u03bbj v + \u03bbjw j = 0 , 1 , ... , k .Then for each j \u2208 0 , ... , k , uj is the limit of the sequence unj : n \u2208 I .For j > 0 , each unj belongs to the closed set Daj , so uj \u2208 Daj .Similarly , for j < k each unj belongs to the closed set Daj +1 , so uj \u2208 Daj +1 .Hence \u2212 \u2192 a , \u2192 \u2212 u is compatible , implying v , w \u2208 CP \u2212 \u2192 a .Now we have Db \u00d7 Dc covered by finitely many closed subsets on each of them \u03c1bc is a constant .Suppose for contradiction that there are v , w , v ' , w ' \u2208 Db \u00d7 Dc such that \u03c1bc v , w = \u03c1bc v ' , w ' .are closed by the finiteness of P .This is a contradiction , since it is well known and easy to prove that a line segment can not be expressed as the disjoint union of two nonempty closed sets .Summarizing corollary 10 , lemma 11 and theorem 12 , we haveLEMMA 14 .\u03c1bc \u2264 Sbc for all b , c \u2208 A. PROOF .For contradiction , suppose \u03c1bc \u2212 Sbc = e > 0 .By the definition of Sbc , there exists v \u2208 f 1 b \u2286 Db with v b \u2212 v c < Sbc + e = \u03c1bc .Pick an arbitrary w \u2208 Dc .By lemma 8 , there is a compatible pair \u2212 \u2192 a , \u2192 \u2212 u \u2208 LCvw bc with S \u2212 \u2192 a \u2264 v b \u2212 v c .Since \u2192 \u2212 a is a straight b , c path , \u03c1bc = S \u2212 \u2192 a \u2264 v b \u2212 v c , leading to a contradiction .Define another edge-weighted complete directed graph G ' f on vertex set A where the weight of arc a , b is \u03c1ab .Immediately from lemma 14 , the weight of every directed cycle in Gf is bounded below by its weight in G ' f. To prove theorem 4 , it suffices to show the zero cycle property of G ' f , i.e. , every directed cycle has weight zero .We begin by considering two-cycles .LEMMA 15 .\u03c1bc + \u03c1cb = 0 for all b , c \u2208 A. PROOF .Let \u2192 \u2212 a be a straight b , c path compatible with linear sequence \u2192 \u2212 u .let \u2192 \u2212 a ' be the reverse of \u2192 \u2212 a and \u2192 \u2212 u ' the reverse of \u2192 \u2212 u .Obviously , \u2212 \u2192 a ' , \u2192 \u2212 u ' is compatible as well and thus \u2192 \u2212 a ' is a straight c , b path .Therefore ,where the final equality uses proposition 5 .Next , for three cycles , we first consider those compatible with linear triples .PROOF .First , we prove for the case where v is between u and w. From lemma 8 , there are compatible pairs \u2212 \u2192 a ' , \u2192 \u2212 u ' \u2208Therefore , \u03c1ac = S \u2212 \u2192 a ' ' ' = S \u2212 \u2192 a ' + S \u2212 \u2192 a ' ' = \u03c1ab + \u03c1bc .Moreover , \u03c1ac = \u2212 \u03c1ca by lemma 15 , so we get \u03c1ab + \u03c1bc + \u03c1ca = 0 .Now suppose w is between u and v. By the above argument , we have \u03c1ac + \u03c1cb + \u03c1ba = 0 and by lemma 15 , \u03c1ab + \u03c1bc + \u03c1ca = \u2212 \u03c1ba \u2212 \u03c1cb \u2212 \u03c1ac = 0 .The case that u is between v and w is similar .Now we are ready for the zero three-cycle property : LEMMA 17 .\u03c1ab + \u03c1bc + \u03c1ca = 0 for all a , b , c \u2208 A. PROOF .Let S = a , b , c : \u03c1ab + \u03c1bc + \u03c1ca = 0 and for contradiction , suppose S = \u2205 .S is finite .For each a \u2208 A , choose va \u2208 Da arbitrarily and let T be the convex hull of va : a \u2208 A .For each a , b , c \u2208 S , let Rabc = Da \u00d7 Db \u00d7 Dc \u2229 T3 .Clearly , each Rabc is nonempty and compact .Moreover , by lemma 16 , no u , v , w \u2208 Rabc is collinear .Define f : D3 \u2192 R by f u , v , w = | v \u2212 u | + | w \u2212 v | + | u \u2212 w | .For a , b , c \u2208 S , the restriction of f to the compact set Rabc attains a minimum m a , b , c at some point u , v , w \u2208 Rabc by the continuity of f , i.e. , there exists a triangle \u2206 uvw of minimum perimeter within T with u \u2208 Da , v \u2208 Db , w \u2208 Dc .Choose a * , b * , c * \u2208 S so that m a * , b * , c * is minimum and let u * , v * , w * \u2208 Ra * b * c * be a triple achieving it .Pick an arbitrary point p in the interior of \u2206 u * v * w * .By the convexity of domain D , there is d \u2208 A such that p \u2208 Dd .Consider triangles \u2206 u \u2217 pw \u2217 , \u2206 w \u2217 pv \u2217 and \u2206 v \u2217 pu \u2217 .Since each of them has perimeter less than that of \u2206 u \u2217 v \u2217 w \u2217 and all three triangles are contained in T , by the minimality of \u2206 u \u2217 v \u2217 w \u2217 , a \u2217 , d , c \u2217 , c \u2217 , d , b \u2217 , b \u2217 , d , a \u2217 \u2208 S. ThusSumming up the three equalities ,With the zero two-cycle and three-cycle properties , the zero cycle property of G ~ f is immediate .As noted earlier , this completes the proof of theorem 4 .PROOF .Clearly , zero two-cycle and three-cycle properties imply triangle equality Pab + Pbc = Pac for all a , b , c \u2208 A. For triangle equality , we have Pk \u2212 1 a directed cycle C = a1a2 ... aka1 , by inductively applyingthe weight of C isAs final remarks , we note that our result implies the following strengthenings of theorem 12 : COROLLARY 19 .For any b , c \u2208 A , every admissible b , c path has the same S-weight Pbc .PROOF .First notice that for any b , c \u2208 A , if Db \u2229 Dc = \u2205 , Sbc = Pbc .To see this , pick v \u2208 Db \u2229 Dc arbitrarily .Obviously , path \u2192 \u2212 a = b , c is compatible with linear sequence \u2192 \u2212 u = v , v , v and is thus a straight b , c path .Hence Pbc = S \u2212 \u2192 a = Sbc .Now for any b , c \u2208 A and any b , c path \u2192 \u2212 a with C \u2212 \u2192 a = \u2205 , let \u2192 \u2212 u \u2208 C \u2212 \u2192 a .Since ui \u2208 Dai \u2229 Dai +1 for i \u2208 | \u2212 \u2192 a | \u2212 1 ,which by theorem 18 , = \u2212 Paka1 = Pa1ak = Pbc .Hence Pbc \u2264 S \u2217 bc , which completes the proof .Theorem 4 applies to social choice functions with convex domain and finite range .We now show that neither of these hypotheses can be omitted .Our examples are single player functions .The first example illustrates that convexity can not be omitted .We present an untruthful single player social choice function with three outcomes a , b , c satisfying W-MON on a path-connected but non-convex domain .The domain is the boundary of a triangle whose vertices are x = 0 , 1 , \u2212 1 , y = \u2212 1 , 0 , 1 and z = 1 , \u2212 1 , 0 .x and the open line segment zx is assigned outcome a , y and the open line segment xy is assigned outcome b , and z and the open line segment yz is assigned outcome c. Clearly , Sab = \u2212 Sba = Sbc = \u2212 Scb = Sca = \u2212 Sac = \u2212 1 , W-MON the nonnegative twocycle property holds .Since there is a negative cycle Sab + Sbc + Sca = \u2212 3 , by lemma 3 , this is not a truthful choice function .We now show that the hypothesis of finite range can not be omitted .We construct a family of single player social choice functions each having a convex domain and an infinite number of outcomes , and satisfying weak monotonicity but not truthfulness .Our examples will be specified by a positive integer n and an n \u00d7 n matrix M satisfying the following properties : 1 M is non-singular .2 M is positive semidefinite .3 There are distinct i1 , i2 , ... , ik \u2208 n satisfyingHere is an example matrix with n = 3 and i1 , i2 , i3 = 1 , 2 , 3 :Let e1 , e2 , ... , en denote the standard basis of Rn .Let Sn denote the convex hull of e1 , e2 ... , en , which is the set of vectors in Rn with nonnegative coordinates that sum to 1 .The range of our social choice function will be the set Sn and the domain D will be indexed by Sn , that is D = y\u03bb : A \u2208 Sn , where y\u03bb is defined below .The function f maps y\u03bb to A. Next we specify y\u03bb .By definition , D must be a set of functions from Sn to R. For A \u2208 Sn , the domain element y\u03bb : Sn \u2212 \u2192 R is defined by y\u03bb \u03b1 = AT M\u03b1 .The nonsingularity of M guarantees that y\u03bb = y\u00b5 for A = \u00b5 \u2208 Sn .It is easy to see that D is a convex subset of the set of all functions from Sn to R .The outcome graph Gf is an infinite graph whose vertex set is the outcome set A = Sn .For outcomes A , \u00b5 \u2208 A , the edge weight S\u03bb\u00b5 is equal to S\u03bb\u00b5 = inf v A \u2212 v \u00b5 : f v = A = y\u03bb A \u2212 y\u03bb \u00b5 = AT MA \u2212 ATM\u00b5 = AT M A \u2212 \u00b5 .We claim that Gf satisfies the nonnegative two-cycle property W-MON but has a negative cycle and hence is not truthful .For outcomes A , \u00b5 \u2208 A ,which is nonnegative since M is positive semidefinite .Hence the nonnegative two-cycle property holds .Next we show that Gf has a negative cycle .Let i1 , i2 , ... , ik be a sequence of indices satisfying property 3 of M .We claim ei1 ei2 ... eik ei1 is a negative cycle .Sincewhich completes the proof .Finally , we point out that the third property imposed on the matrix M has the following interpretation .Let R M = r1 , r2 , ... , rn be the set of row vectors of M and let hM be the single player social choice function with domain R M and range 1 , 2 , ... , n mapping ri to i. Property 3 is equivalent to the condition that the outcome graph GhM has a negative cycle .By lemma 3 , this is equivalent to the condition that hM is untruthful .", "conclusions": "As stated in the introduction , the goal underlying the work in this paper is to obtain useful and general characterizations of truthfulness .Let us say that a set D of P x A real valuation matrices is a WM-domain if any social choice function on D satisfying weak monotonicity is truthful .In this paper , we showed that for finite A , any convex D is a WM-domain .Typically , the domains of social choice functions considered in mechanism design are convex , but there are interesting examples with non-convex domains , e.g. , combinatorial auctions with unknown single-minded bidders .It is intriguing to find the most general conditions under which a set D of real matrices is a WM-domain .We believe that convexity is the main part of the story , i.e. , a WM-domain is , after excluding some exceptional cases , '' essentially '' a convex set .Turning to parametric representations , let us say a set D of P x A matrices is an AM-domain if any truthful social choice function with domain D is an affine maximizer .Roberts ' theorem says that the unrestricted domain is an AM-domain .What are the most general conditions under which a set D of real matrices is an AM-domain ?"}
