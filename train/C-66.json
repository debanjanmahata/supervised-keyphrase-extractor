here we assume that the workflows represent requested service from customers or automated systems and that the workflow has already been composed with an existing choreography toolkit .These workflows are then submitted to a portal not shown that acts as a scheduling agent between the web service consumers and the web service providers .In this example , a workflow could represent the actions needed to instantiate a vacation itinerary , where one business process requests booking an airline ticket , another business process requests a hotel room , and so forth .Each of these requests target a particular service type e.g. airline reservations , hotel reservations , car reservations , etc. , and for each service type , there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a web service interface .An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service QoS metric , such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes , and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow ; intuitively , it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals .We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency .The resulting problem is then to schedule and assign the business processes ' requests for service types to one of the service providers for that type .The scheduling must be done such that the aggregate business value across all the workflows is maximised .In Section 3 we state the scenario as a combinatorial problem and utilise a genetic search algorithm 5 to find the best assignment of web service requests to providers .This approach converges towards an assignment that maximises the overall business value for all the workflows .In Section 4 we show through experimentation that this search heuristic finds better assignments than other algorithms greedy , round-robin , and proportional .Further , this approach allows us to scale the number of simultaneous workflows up to one thousand workflows in our experiments and yet still find effective schedules .", "title": "Heuristics-Based Scheduling of Composite Web Service Workloads", "author_keywords_stem": ["web service", "qo", "work\u00ef\u00ac\u201aows", "schedule", "heuristic"], "abstract": "Web services can be aggregated to create composite workflows that provide streamlined functionality for human users or other systems .Although industry standards and recent research have sought to define best practices and to improve end-to-end workflow composition , one area that has not fully been explored is the scheduling of a workflow 's web service requests to actual service provisioning in a multi-tiered , multi-organisation environment .This issue is relevant to modern business scenarios where business processes within a workflow must complete within QoS-defined limits .Because these business processes are web service consumers , service requests must be mapped and scheduled across multiple web service providers , each with its own negotiated service level agreement .In this paper we provide heuristics for scheduling service requests from multiple business process workflows to web service providers such that a business value metric across all workflows is maximised .We show that a genetic search algorithm is appropriate to perform this scheduling , and through experimentation we show that our algorithm scales well up to a thousand workflows and produces better mappings than traditional approaches .", "id": "C-66", "combined_keywords_stem": ["streamlin function", "end-to-end workflow composit", "schedul agent", "servic request", "heurist", "schedul servic", "busi process workflow", "busi valu metric", "multi-tier system", "multi-organis environ", "qo-defin limit", "web servic", "qo", "work\u00ef\u00ac\u201aow", "schedul"], "evaluation": "In this section we show the benefit of using our GA-based scheduler .Because we wanted to scale the scenarios up to a large number of workflows up to 1000 in our experiments , we implemented a simulation program that allowed us to vary parameters and to measure the results with different metrics .The simulator was written in standard C++ and was run on a Linux Fedora Core desktop computer running at 2.8 GHz with 1GB of RAM .We compared our algorithm against alternative candidates :In the experiments that follow , all results were averaged across 20 trials , and to help normalise the effects of randomisation used during the GA , each trial started by reading in pre-initialised data from disk .In Table 1 we list our experimental parameters .In Figure 3 we show the results of running our GA against the three candidate alternatives .The x-axis shows the number for workflows scaled up to 1000 , and the y-axis shows the aggregate business value for all workflows .As can be seen , the GA consistently produces the highest business value even as the number of workflows grows ; at 1000 workflows , the GA produces a 115 % improvement over the next-best alternative .Note that although we are optimising against the business value metric we defined earlier , genetic algorithms are able to converge towards the optimal value of any metric , as long as the evaluation function can consistently measure a chromosome 's value with that metric .As expected , the greedy algorithm performs very poorly because it does the worst job at balancing load : all business processes for a given service type are assigned to only one server the one advertised to have the fastest completion time , and as more business processes arrive , the provider 's performance degrades linearly .The round-robin scheme is initially outperformed by the randomproportional scheme up to around 120 workflows as shown in the magnified graph of Figure 4 , but as the number of workflows increases , the round-robin scheme consistently wins over randomproportional .The reason is that although the random-proportional scheme assigns business processes to providers proportionally according to the advertised completion times which is a measure of the `` power '' of the service provider , even the best providers will eventually reach a real-world maximum concurrency for the largenumber of workflows that we are considering .For a very large number of workflows , the round-robin scheme is able to better balance the load across all service providers .To better understand the behaviour resulting from the scheduling assignments , we show the workflow completion results in Figures 5 , 6 , and 7 for 100 , 500 , and 900 workflows , respectively .These figures show the percentage of workflows that are successful can complete with their QoS limit , acceptable can complete within r , = 3 times their QoS limit , and failed can not complete within r , = 3 times their QoS limit .The GA consistently produces the highest percentage of successful workflows resulting in higher business values for the aggregate set of workflows .Further , the round-robin scheme produces better results than the random-proportional for a large number of workflows but does not perform as well as the GA. .In Figure 8 we graph the `` makespan '' resulting from the same experiments above .Makespan is a traditional metric from the job scheduling community measuring elapsed time for the last job to complete .While useful , it does not capture the high-level business value metric that we are optimising against .Indeed , the makespan is oblivious to the fact that we provide multiple levels of completion successful , acceptable , and failed and assign business value scores accordingly .For completeness , we note that the GA provides the fastest makespan , but it is matched by the round robin algorithm .The GA produces better business values as shown in Figure 3 because it is able to search the solution space to find better mappings that produce more successful workflows as shown in Figures 5 to 7 .We also looked at the effect of the scheduling algorithms on balancing the load .Figure 9 shows the percentage of services providers that were accessed while the workflows ran .As expected , the greedy algorithm always hits one service provider ; on the other hand , the round-robin algorithm is the fastest to spread the businessprocesses .Figure 10 is the percentage of accessed service providers that is , the percentage of service providers represented in Figure 9 that had more assigned business processes than their advertised maximum concurrency .For example , in the greedy algorithm only one service provider is utilised , and this one provider quickly becomes saturated .On the other hand , the random-proportional algorithm uses many service providers , but because business processes are proportionally assigned with more assignments going to the better providers , there is a tendency for a smaller percentage of providers to become saturated .For completeness , we show the performance of the genetic algorithm itself in Figure 11 .The algorithm scales linearly with an increasing number of workflows .We note that the round-robin , random-proportional , and greedy algorithms all finished within 1 second even for the largest workflow configuration .However , we feel that the benefit of finding much higher business value scores justifies the running time of the GA ; further we would expect that the running time will improve with both software tuning as well as with a computer faster than our off-the-shelf PC .", "combined_keywords": ["streamlined functionality", "end-to-end workflow composition", "scheduling agent", "service request", "heuristic", "scheduling service", "business process workflow", "business value metric", "multi-tiered system", "multi-organisation environment", "qos-defined limit", "web service", "qo", "work\u00ef\u00ac\u201aows", "schedule"], "author_keywords": ["web service", "qo", "work\u00ef\u00ac\u201aows", "schedule", "heuristic"], "method": "In this section we describe our model and discuss how we can find scheduling assignments using a genetic search algorithm .We base our model on the simplified scenario shown in Figure 1 .Specifically , we assume that users or automated systems request the execution of a workflow .The workflows comprise business processes , each of which makes one web service invocation to a service type .Further , business processes have an ordering in the workflow .The arrangement and execution of the business processes and the data flow between them are all managed by a composition or choreography tool e.g. 1 , 9 .Although composition languages can use sophisticated flow-control mechanisms such as conditional branches , for simplicity we assume the processes execute sequentially in a given order .This scenario can be naturally extended to more complex relationships that can be expressed in BPEL 7 , which defines how business processes interact , messages are exchanged , activities are ordered , and exceptions are handled .Due to space constraints , we focus on the problem space presented here and will extend our model to more advanced deployment scenarios in the future .Each workflow has a QoS requirement to complete within a specified number of time units e.g. on the order of seconds , as detailed in the Experiments section .Upon completion or failure , the workflow is assigned a business value .We extended this approach further and considered different types of workflow completion in order to model differentiated QoS levels that can be applied by businesses for example , to provide tiered customer service .We say that a workflow is successful if it completes within its QoS requirement , acceptable if it completes within a constant factor \u03baof its QoS bound in our experiments we chose \u03ba = 3 , or failing if it finishes beyond \u03ba times its QoS bound .For each category , a business value score is assigned to the workflow , with the `` successful '' category assigned the highest positive score , followed by `` acceptable '' and then `` failing . ''The business value point distribution is non-uniform across workflows , further modelling cases where some workflows are of higher priority than others .Each service type is implemented by a number of different service providers .We assume that the providers make service level agreements SLAs to guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation .Although SLAs can be complex , in this paper we assume for simplicity that the guarantees can take the form of a linear performance degradation under load .This guarantee is defined by several parameters : \u03b1 is the expected completion time for example , on the order of seconds if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to \u03b2 , the maximum concurrency , and if the workload is higher than \u03b2 , the expected completion for a workload of size \u03c9 is \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b2 where \u03b3 is a fractional coefficient .In our experiments we vary \u03b1 , \u03b2 , and \u03b3 with different distributions .Ideally , all workflows would be able to finish within their QoS limits and thus maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows .However , because we model service providers with degrading performance under load , not all workflows will achieve their QoS limit : it may easily be the case that business processes are assigned to providers who are overloaded and can not complete within the respective workflow 's QoS limit .The key research problem , then , is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows .Given that the scope of the optimisation is the entire set of workflows , it may be that the best scheduling assignments may result in some workflows having to fail in order for more workflows to succeed .This intuitive observation suggests that traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or proportional assignments will not fare well , which is what we observe and discuss in Section 4 .On the other hand , an exhaustive search of all the possible assignments will find the best schedule , but the computational complexity is prohibitively high .Suppose there are W workflows with an average of B business processes per workflow .Further , in the worst case each business process requests one service type , for which there are P providers .There are thus W \u00b7 PB combinations to explore to find the optimal assignments of business processes to providers .Even for small configurations e.g. W = 10 , B = 5 , P = 10 , the computational time for exhaustive search is significant , and in our work we look to scale these parameters .In the next subsection , discuss how a genetic search algorithm can be used to converge toward the optimum scheduling assignments .Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers , the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows .To explore the solution space , we use a genetic algorithm GA search heuristic that simulates Darwinian natural selection by having members of a population compete to survive in order to pass their genetic chromosomes onto the next generation ; after successive generations , there is a tendency for the chromosomes to converge toward the best combination 5 6 .Although other search heuristics exist that can solve optimization problems e.g. simulated annealing or steepest-ascent hillclimbing , the business process scheduling problem fits well with a GA because potential solutions can be represented in a matrix form and allows us to use prior research in effective GA chromosome recombination to form new members of the population e.g. 2 .assignment of workflow , service type + service provider .Each row represents a workflow , and each column represents a service type .For example , here there are 3 workflows 0 to 2 and 5 service types 0 to 4 .In workflow 0 , any request for service type 3 goes to provider 2 .Note that the service provider identifier is within a range limited to its service type i.e. its column , so the `` 2 '' listed for service type 3 is a different server from server `` 2 '' in other columns .Chromosome representation of a solution .In Figure 2 we show an example chromosome that encodes one scheduling assignment .The representation is a 2-dimensional matrix that maps workflow , service type to a service provider .For a business process in workflow i and utilising service type j , the i , j th entry in the table is the identifier for the service provider to which the business process is assigned .Note that the service provider identifier is within a range limited to its service type .GA execution .A GA proceeds as follows .Initially a random set of chromosomes is created for the population .The chromosomes are evaluated hashed to some metric , and the best ones are chosen to be parents .In our problem , the evaluation produces the net business value across all workflows after executing all business processes once they are assigned to their respective service providers according to the mapping in the chromosome .The parents recombine to produce children , simulating sexual crossover , and occasionally a mutation may arise which produces new characteristics that were not available in either parent .The principal idea is that we would like the children to be different from the parents in order to explore more of the solution space yet not too different in order to contain the portions of the chromosome that result in good scheduling assignments .Note that finding the global optimum is not guaranteed because the recombination and mutation are stochastic .GA recombination and mutation .As mentioned , the chromosomes are 2-dimensional matrices that represent scheduling assignments .To simulate sexual recombination of two chromosomes to produce a new child chromosome , we applied a one-point crossover scheme twice once along each dimension .The crossover is best explained by analogy to Cartesian space as follows .A random point is chosen in the matrix to be coordinate 0 , 0 .Matrix elements from quadrants II and IV from the first parent and elements from quadrants I and III from the second parent are used to create the new child .This approach follows GA best practices by keeping contiguous chromosome segments together as they are transmitted from parent to child .The uni-chromosome mutation scheme randomly changes one of the service provider assignments to another provider within the available range .Other recombination and mutation schemes are an area of research in the GA community , and we look to explore new operators in future work .GA evaluation function .An important GA component is the evaluation function .Given a particular chromosome representing one scheduling mapping , the function deterministically calculates the net business value across all workloads .The business processes in each workload are assigned to service providers , and each provider 's completion time is calculated based on the service agreement guarantee using the parameters mentioned in Section 3.1 , namely the unloaded completion time \u03b1 , the maximum concurrency \u03b2 , and a coefficient \u03b3 that controls the linear performance degradation under heavy load .Note that the evaluation function can be easily replaced if desired ; for example , other evaluation functions can model different service provider guarantees or parallel workflows .", "conclusions": "Business processes within workflows can be orchestrated to access web services .In this paper we looked at multi-tiered service provisioning where web service requests to service types can be mapped to different service providers .The resulting problem is that in order to support a very large number of workflows , the assignment of business process to web service provider must be intelligent .We used a business value metric to measure the behaviour of workflows meeting or failing QoS values , and we optimised our scheduling to maximise the aggregate business value across all workflows .Since the solution space of scheduler mappings is exponential , we used a genetic search algorithm to search the space and converge toward the best schedule .With a default configuration for all parameters and using our business value scoring , the GA produced up to 115 % business value improvement over the next best algorithm .Finally , because a genetic algorithm will converge towards the optimal value using any metric even other than the business value metric we used , we believe our approach has strong potential for continuing work .In future work , we look to acquire real-world traces of web service instances in order to get better estimates of service agreement guarantees , although we expect that such guarantees between the providers and their consumers are not generally available to the public .We will also look at other QoS metrics such as CPU and I/O usage .For example , we can analyse transfer costs with varying bandwidth , latency , data size , and data distribution .Further , we hope to improve our genetic algorithm and compare it to more scheduler alternatives .Finally , since our work is complementary to existing work in web services choreography because we rely on pre-configured workflows , we look to integrate our approach with available web service workflow systems expressed in BPEL .", "related work": "In the context of service assignment and scheduling , 11 maps web service calls to potential servers using linear programming , but their work is concerned with mapping only single workflows ; our principal focus is on scalably scheduling multiple workflows upto one thousand as we show later using different business metrics and a search heuristic .10 presents a dynamic provisioning approach that uses both predictive and reactive techniques for multi-tiered Internet application delivery .However , the provisioning techniques do not consider the challenges faced when there are alternative query execution plans and replicated data sources .8 presents a feedback-based scheduling mechanism for multi-tiered systems with back-end databases , but unlike our work , it assumes a tighter coupling between the various components of the system .Our work also builds upon prior scheduling research .The classic job-shop scheduling problem , shown to be NP-complete 4 3 , is similar to ours in that tasks within a job must be scheduled onto machinery c.f. our scenario is that business processes within a workflow must be scheduled onto web service providers .The salient differences are that the machines can process only one job at a time we assume servers can multi-task but with degraded performance and a maximum concurrency level , tasks within a job can not simultaneously run on different machines we assume business processes can be assigned to any available server , and the principal metric of performance is the makespan , which is the time for the last task among all the jobs to complete and as we show later , optimising on the makespan is insufficient for scheduling the business processes , necessitating different metrics ."}
