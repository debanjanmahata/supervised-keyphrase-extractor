behavior of agents and multi-agent systems .In this paper , we extend modal logics of time and knowledge with a concept of plausible behavior : this notionis added to the language of CTLK 19 , which is a straightforward combination of the branching-time temporal logic CTL 4 , 3 and standard epistemic logic 9 , 5 .In our approach , plausibility can be seen as a temporal property of behaviors .That is , some behaviors of the system can be assumed plausible and others implausible , with the underlying idea that the latter should perhaps be ignored in practical reasoning about possible future courses of action .Moreover , behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the Kripke structure modeling a multiagent system .As a consequence , we obtain a language to reason about what can or must plausibly happen .We propose a particular notion of beliefs inspired by 20 , 7 , defined in terms of epistemic relations and plausibility .The main intuition is that beliefs are facts that an agent would know if he assumed that only plausible things could happen .We believe that humans use such a concept of plausibility and `` practical beliefs '' quite often in their everyday reasoning .Restricting one 's reasoning to plausible possibilities is essential to make the reasoning feasible , as the space of all possibilities is exceedingly large in real life .We investigate some important properties of plausibility , knowledge , and belief in this new framework .In particular , we show that knowledge is an S5 modality , and that beliefs satisfy axioms K45 in general , and KD45 for the class of plausibly serial models .Finally , we show that the relationship between knowledge and belief for plausibly serial models is natural and reflects the initial intuition well .We also show how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility update operator , and we study properties of such updates .Finally , we show that model checking of the new logic is no more complex than model checking CTL and CTLK .Our ultimate goal is to come up with a logic that allows the study of strategies , time , knowledge , and plausible/rational behavior under both perfect and imperfect information .As combining all these dimensions is highly nontrivial cf. 12 , 14 it seems reasonable to split this task .While this paper deals with knowledge , plausibility , and belief , the companion paper 11 proposes a general framework for multi-agent systems that regard game-theoretical rationality criteria like Nash equilibrium , Pareto optimality , etc. .The latter approach is based on the more powerful logic ATL 1 .The paper is structured as follows .Firstly , we briefly present branching-time logic with knowledge , CTLK .In Section 3 we present our approach to plausibility and formally define CTLK with plausibility .We also show howtemporal formulae can be used to describe plausible paths , and we compare our logic with existing related work .In Section 4 , properties of knowledge , belief , and plausibility are explored .Finally , we present verification complexity results for CTLKP in Section 5 .", "title": "Agents ,

framework for agents ' beliefs about how the world can or must evolve .Thus , we need a notion of time and change , plus a notion of what the agents are supposed to know in particular situations .CTLK 19 is a straightforward combination of the computation tree logic CTL 4 , 3 and standard epistemic logic 9 , 5 .CTL includes operators for temporal properties of systems : i.e. , path quantifier E `` there is a path '' , together with temporal operators : \u2762 `` in the next state '' , \u2751 `` always from now on '' and U `` until '' .1 Every occurrence of a temporal operator is preceded by exactly one path quantifier in CTL this variant of the language is sometimes called `` vanilla '' CTL .Epistemic logic uses operators for representing agents ' knowledge : Ka\u03d5 is read as `` agent a knows that \u03d5 '' .Let \u03a0 be a set of atomic propositions with a typical element p , and Agt = 1 , ... , k be a set of agents with a typical element a .The language of CTLK consists of formulae \u03d5 , given as follows :We will sometimes refer to formulae \u03d5 as `` vanilla '' state formulae and to formulae \u03b3 as `` vanilla '' path formulae .The semantics of CTLK is based on Kripke models M = ~ Q , R , \u223c 1 , ... , \u223c k , \u03c0 ~ , which include a nonempty set of states Q , a state transition relation R \u2286 Q \u00d7 Q , epistemic indistinguishability relations \u223c a \u2286 Q \u00d7 Q one per agent , and a valuation of propositions \u03c0 : \u03a0 \u2192 P Q .We assume that relation R is serial and that all \u223c a are equivalence relations .A path \u03bb in M refers to a possible behavior or computation of system M , and can be represented as an infinite sequence of states that follow relation R , that is , a sequence q0q1q2 ... such that qiRqi +1 for every i = 0 , 1 , 2 , ... We denote the ith state in \u03bb by \u03bb i .The set of all paths in M is denoted by \u039bM if the model is clear from context , M will be omitted .A q-path is a path that starts from q , i.e. , \u03bb 0 = q .A q-subpath is a sequence of states , starting from q , which is a subpath of some path in the model , i.e. a sequence q0q1 ... such that q = q0 and there are q0 , ... , qi such that q0 ... qiq0q1 ... \u2208 \u039bM .2 The semantics of CTLK is defined as follows :In this section we discuss the central concept of this paper , i.e. the concept of plausibility .First , we outline the idea informally .Then , we extend CTLK with the notion of plausibility by adding plausible path operators Pl a and physical path operator Ph to the logic .Formula Pl a\u03d5 has the intended meaning : according to agent a , it is plausible that \u03d5 holds ; formula Ph \u03d5 reads as : \u03d5 holds in all `` physically '' possible scenarios i.e. , even in implausible ones .The plausible path operator restricts statements only to those paths which are defined to be `` sensible '' , whereas the physical path operator generates statements about all paths that may theoretically occur .Furthermore , we define beliefs on top of plausibility and knowledge , as the facts that an agent would know if he assumed that only plausible things could happen .Finally , we discuss related work 7 , 8 , 20 , 18 , 16 , and compare it with our approach .It is well known how knowledge or beliefs can be modeled with Kripke structures .However , it is not so obvious how we can capture knowledge and beliefs in a sensible way in one framework .Clearly , there should be a connection between these two notions .Our approach is to use the notion of plausibility for this purpose .Plausibility can serve as a primitive concept that helps to define the semantics of beliefs , in a similar way as indistinguishability of states represented by relation \u223c a is the semantic concept that underlies knowledge .In this sense , our work follows 7 , 20 : essentially , beliefs are what an agent would know if he took only plausible options into account .In our approach , however , plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal property .That is , we do not consider states or possible worlds to be more plausible than others but rather define some behaviors to be plausible , and others implausible .Moreover , behaviors can be formally understood as temporal paths in the Kripke structure modeling a multi-agent system .An actual notion of plausibility that is , a particular set of plausible paths can emerge in many different ways .It may result from observations and learning ; an agent can learn from its observations and see specific patterns of events as plausible `` a lot of people wear black shoes if they wear a suit '' .Knowledge exchange is another possibility e.g. , an agent a can tell agent b that `` player c always bluffs when he is smiling '' .Game theory , with its rationality criteria undominated strategies , maxmin , Nash equilibrium etc. is another viable source of plausibility assumptions .Last but not least , folk knowledge can be used to establish plausibilityrelated classifications of behavior `` players normally want to win a game '' , `` people want to live '' .In any case , restricting the reasoning to plausible possibilities can be essential if we want to make the reasoning feasible , as the space of all possibilities we call them `` physical '' possibilities in the rest of the paper is exceedingly large in real life .Of course , this does not exclude a more extensive analysis in special cases , e.g. when our plausibility assumptions do not seem accurate any more , or when the cost ofinaccurate assumptions can be too high as in the case of high-budget business decisions .But even in these cases , we usually do not get rid of plausibility assumptions completely we only revise them to make them more cautious .3 To formalize this idea , we extend models of CTLK with sets of plausible paths and add plausibility operators Pl a , physical paths operator Ph , and belief operators Ba to the language of CTLK .Now , it is possible to make statements that refer to plausible paths only , as well as statements that regard all paths that may occur in the system .In this section , we extend the logic of CTLK with plausibility ; we call the resulting logic CTLKP .Formally , the language of CTLKP is defined as :For instance , we may claim it is plausible to assume that a shop is closed after the opening hours , though the manager may be physically able to open it at any time : Pl aA \u2751 late \u2192 \u00ac open \u2227 Ph E \u2666 late \u2227 open .The semantics of CTLKP extends that of CTLK as follows .Firstly , we augment the models with sets of plausible paths .A model with plausibility is given aswhere ~ Q , R , \u223c 1 , ... , \u223c k , \u03c0 ~ is a CTLK model , and Ta \u2286 \u039bm is the set of paths in M that are plausible according to agent a .If we want to make it clear that Ta is taken from model M , we will write Tam .It seems worth emphasizing that this notion of plausibility is subjective and holistic .It is subjective because Ta represents agent a 's subjective view on what is plausible and indeed , different agents may have different ideas on plausibility i.e. , Ta may differ from Tb .It is holistic because Ta represents agent a 's idea of the plausible behavior of the whole system including the behavior of other agents .REMARK 1 .In our models , plausibility is also global , i.e. , plausibility sets do not depend on the state of the system .Investigating systems , in which plausibility is relativized with respect to states like in 7 , might be an interesting avenue of future work .However , such an approach while obviously more flexible allows for potentially counterintuitive system descriptions .For example , it might be the case that path \u03bb is plausible in q = \u03bb 0 , but the set of plausible paths in q ' = \u03bb 1 is empty .That is , by following plausible path \u03bb we are bound to get to an implausible situation .But then , does it make sense to consider \u03bb as plausible ?Secondly , we use a non-standard satisfaction relation | =P , which we call plausible satisfaction .Let M be a CTLKP 3That is , when planning to open an industrial plant in the UK , we will probably consider the possibility of our main contractor taking her life , but we will still not take into account the possibilities of : an invasion of UFO , England being destroyed by a meteorite , Fidel Castro becoming the British Prime Minister etc. .Note that this is fundamentally different from using a probabilistic model in which all these unlikely scenarios are assigned very low probabilities : in that case , they also have a very small influence on our final decision , but we must process the whole space of physical possibilities to evaluate the options .model and P \u2286 \u039bm be an arbitrary subset of paths in M not necessarily any Ta m .| =P restricts the evaluation of temporal formulae to the paths given in P only .The `` absolute '' satisfaction relation | = is defined as | = \u039bM .Let on P be the set of all states that lie on at least one path in P , i.e. on P = q \u2208 Q | \u2203 \u03bb \u2208 P \u2203 i \u03bb i = q .Now , the semantics of CTLKP can be given through the following clauses :One of the main reasons for using the concept of plausibility is that we want to define agents ' beliefs out of more primitive concepts in our case , these are plausibility and indistinguishability in a way analogous to 20 , 7 .If an agent knows that \u03d5 , he must be `` sure '' about it .However , beliefs of an agent are not necessarily about reliable facts .Still , they should make sense to the agent ; if he believes that \u03d5 , then the formula should at least hold in all futures that he envisages as plausible .Thus , beliefs of an agent may be seen as things known to him if he disregards all non-plausible possibilities .We say that \u03d5 is M-true M | = \u03d5 if M , q | = \u03d5 for all q \u2208 Qm .\u03d5 is valid | = \u03d5 if M | = \u03d5 for all models M. \u03d5 is M-strongly true M | \u2261 \u03d5 if M , q | =P \u03d5 for all q \u2208 Qm and all P \u2286 \u039bm .\u03d5 is strongly valid | \u2261 \u03d5 if M | \u2261 \u03d5 for all models M. PROPOSITION 2 .Strong truth and strong validity imply truth and validity , respectively .The reverse does not hold .Ultimately , we are going to be interested in normal not strong validity , as parameterizing the satisfaction relation with a set P is just a technical device for propagating sets of plausible paths Ta into the semantics of nested formulae .The importance of strong validity , however , lies in the fact that | \u2261 \u03d5 \u2194 \u03c8 makes \u03d5 and \u03c8 completely interchangeable , while the same is not true for normal validity .PROPOSITION 3 .Let \u03a6 \u03d5 / \u03c8 denote formula \u03a6 in which every occurrence of \u03c8 was replaced by \u03d5 .Also , let | \u2261 \u03d5 \u2194 \u03c8 .Then for all M , q , P : M , q | =P \u03a6 iff M , q | =P \u03a6 \u03d5 / \u03c8 in particular , M , q | = \u03a6 iff M , q | = \u03a6 \u03d5 / \u03c8 .Note that | = \u03d5 \u2194 \u03c8 does not even imply that M , q | = \u03a6 iff M , q | = \u03a6 \u03d5 / \u03c8 .a chooses a real number r \u2208 0 , 1 without revealing the number to b ; then , b chooses a real number r ' \u2208 0 , 1 .The agents win the game and collect EUR 1 , 000 , 000 if both chose 1 , otherwise they lose .Formally , we model the game with a CTLKP model M , in which the set of states Q includes qs for the initial situation , states qr , r \u2208 0 , 1 , for the situations after a has chosen number r , and `` final '' states qw , ql for the winning and the losing situation , respectively .The transition relation is as follows : qsRqr and qrRql for all r \u2208 0 , 1 ; q1Rqw , qwRqw , and qlRql .Moreover , \u03c0 one = q1 and \u03c0 win = qw .Player a has perfect information in the game i.e. , q \u223c a q ' iff q = q ' , but player b does not distinguish between states qr i.e. , qr \u223c b qr ' for all r , r ' \u2208 0 , 1 .Obviously , the only sensible thing to do for both agents is to choose 1 using game-theoretical vocabulary , these strategies are strongly dominant for the respective players .Thus , there is only one plausible course of events if we assume that our players are rational , and hence \u03a5a = \u03a5b = qsq1qwqw ... .Note that , in principle , the outcome of the game is uncertain : M , qs | = \u00ac A0 win \u2227 \u00ac A \u2751 \u00ac win .However , assuming rationality of the players makes it only plausible that the game must end up with a win : M , qs | = Pla A0 win \u2227 Plb A0 win , and the agents believe that this will be the case : M , qs | = BaA0 win \u2227 BbA0 win .Note also that , in any of the states qr , agent b believes that a being rational has played 1 : M , qr | = Bbone for all r \u2208 0 , 1 .So far , we have assumed that sets of plausible paths are somehow given in models .In this section we present a dynamic approach where an actual notion of plausibility can be specified in the object language .Note that we want to specify usually infinite sets of infinite paths , and we need a finite representation of these structures .One logical solution is given by using path formulae \u03b3 .These formulae describe properties of paths ; therefore , a specific formula can be used to characterize a set of paths .For instance , think about a country in Africa where it has never snowed .Then , plausible paths might be defined as ones in which it never snows , i.e. , all paths that satisfy \u2751 \u00ac snows .Formally , let \u03b3 be a CTLK path formula .We define | \u03b3 | M to be the set of paths that satisfy \u03b3 in model M :Moreover , we define the plausible paths model update as follows .Let M = Q , R , \u223c 1 , ... , \u223c k , \u03a51 , ... , \u03a5k , \u03c0 be a CTLKP model , and let P \u2286 \u039bm be a set of paths .Then Ma , P = Q , R , \u223c 1 , ... , \u223c k , \u03a51 , ... , \u03a5a-1 , P , \u03a5a +1 , ... , \u03a5k , \u03c0 denotes model M with a 's set of plausible paths reset to P .Now we can extend the language of CTLKP with formulae set-pla \u03b3 \u03d5 with the intuitive reading : `` suppose that \u03b3 exactly characterizes the set of plausible paths , then \u03d5 holds '' , and formal semantics given below : M , q | =P set-pla \u03b3 \u03d5 iff Ma ,1 \u03b31M , q | =P \u03d5 .We observe that this update scheme is similar to the one proposed in 13 .Several modal notions of plausibility were already discussed in the existing literature 7 , 8 , 20 , 18 , 16 .In these papers , like in ours , plausibility is used as a primitive semantic concept that helps to define beliefs on top of agents ' knowledge .A similar idea was introduced by Moses and Shoham in 18 .Their work preceded both 7 , 8 and 20 and although Moses and Shoham do not explicitly mention the term `` plausibility '' , it seems appropriate to summarize their idea first .In 18 , beliefs are relativized with respect to a formula \u03b1 which can be seen as a plausibility assumption expressed in the object language .More precisely , worlds that satisfy \u03b1 can be considered as plausible .This concept is expressed via symbols B\u03b1i \u03d5 ; the index i \u2208 1 , 2 , 3 is used to distinguish between three different implementations of beliefs .The first version is given by B\u03b11 \u03d5 \u2261 K \u03b1 \u2192 \u03d5 .4 A drawback of this version is that if \u03b1 is false , then everything will be believed with respect to \u03b1 .The second version overcomes this problem : B\u03b12 \u03d5 \u2261 K \u03b1 \u2192 \u03d5 \u2227 K \u00ac \u03b1 \u2192 K\u03d5 ; now \u03d5 is only believed if it is known that \u03d5 follows from assumption \u03b1 , and \u03d5 must be known if assumption \u03b1 is known to be false .Finally , B\u03b13 \u03d5 \u2261 K \u03b1 \u2192 \u03d5 \u2227 \u00ac K \u00ac \u03b1 : if the assumption \u03b1 is known to be false , nothing should be believed with respect to \u03b1 .The strength of these different notions is given as follows : B\u03b13 \u03d5 implies B\u03b12 \u03d5 , and B\u03b12 \u03d5 implies B\u03b11 \u03d5 .In this approach , belief is strongly connected to knowledge in the sense that belief is knowledge with respect to a given assumption .The work of Friedman and Halpern 7 extends the concepts of knowledge and belief with an explicit notion of plausibility ; i.e. , some worlds are more plausible for an agent than others .To implement this idea , Kripke models are extended with function P which assigns a plausibility space P q , a = \u03a9 q , a , ~ q , a to every state , or more generally every possible world q , and agent a .The plausibility space 4Unlike in most approaches , K is interpreted over all worlds and not only over the indistinguishable worlds .is just a partially ordered subset of states/worlds ; that is , \u03a9 q , a \u2286 Q , and ~ q , a \u2286 Q \u00d7 Q is a reflexive and transitive relation .Let S , T \u2286 \u03a9 q , a be finite subsets of states ; now , T is defined to be plausible given S with respect to P q , a , denoted by S \u2192 P q , a T , iff all minimal points/states in S with respect to ~ q , a are also in T. 5 Friedman and Halpern 's view to modal plausibility is closely related to probability and , more generally , plausibility measures .Logics of plausibility can be seen as a qualitative description of agents preferences/knowledge ; logics of probability 6 , 15 , on the other hand , offer a quantitative description .The logic from 7 is defined by the following grammar : \u03d5 : : = p | \u03d5 \u2227 \u03d5 | \u00ac \u03d5 | Ka\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2192 a \u03d5 , where the semantics of all operators except \u2192 a is given as usual , and formulae \u03d5 \u2192 a \u03c8 have the meaning that \u03c8 is true in the most plausible worlds in which \u03d5 holds .Formally , the semantics for \u2192 a is given as : M , q | = \u03d5 \u2192 a \u03c8 iff S\u03d5P q , a \u2192 P q , a S\u03c8P q , a , where S\u03d5 q , a = q ' \u2208 \u03a9 q , a | M , q ' | = \u03d5 are the states in \u03a9 q , a that satisfy \u03d5 .The idea of defining beliefs is given by the assumption that an agent believes in something if he knows that it is true in the most plausible worlds of \u03a9 q , a ; formally , this can be stated as Ba\u03d5 \u2261 Ka ~ \u2192 a \u03d5 .Friedman and Halpern have shown that the KD45 axioms are valid for operator Ba if plausibility spaces satisfy consistency for all states q \u2208 Q it holds that \u03a9 q , a \u2286 q ' \u2208 Q | q \u223c a q ' and normality for all states q \u2208 Q it holds that \u03a9 q , a = \u2205 .6 A temporal extension of the language mentioned briefly in 7 , and discussed in more detail in 8 uses the interpreted systems approach 10 , 5 .A system R is given by runs , where a run r : N \u2192 Q is a function from time moments modeled by N to global states , and a time point r , i is given by a time point i \u2208 N and a run r .A global state is a combination of local states , one per agent .An interpreted system M = R , \u03c0 is given by a system R and a valuation of propositions \u03c0 .Epistemic relations are defined over time points , i.e. , r ' , m ' \u223c a r , m iff agent a 's local states r ' a m ' and ra m of r ' , m ' and r , m are equal .Formulae are interpreted in a straightforward way with respect to interpreted systems , e.g. M , r , m | = Ka\u03d5 iff M , r ' , m ' | = \u03d5 for all r ' , m ' \u223c a r , m .Now , these are time points that play the role of possible worlds ; consequently , plausibility spaces P r , m , a are assigned to each point r , m and agent a.Su et al. 20 have developed a multi-modal , computationally grounded logic with modalities K , B , and C knowledge , belief , and certainty .The computational model consists of global states q = qvis , qinv , qper , Qpls where the environment is divided into a visible qvis and an invisible part qinv , and qper captures the agent 's perception of the visible part of the environment .External sources may provide the agent with information about the invisible part of a state , which results in a set of states Qpls that are plausible for the agent .Given a global state q , we additionally define Vis q = qvis , Inv q = qinv , Per q = qper , and Pls q = Qpls .The 5When there are infinite chains ... ~ q3 ~ q2 ~ a q1 , the definition is much more sophisticated .An interested reader is referred to 7 for more details .6Note that this `` normality '' is essentially seriality of states wrt plausibility spaces .semantics is given by an extension of interpreted systems 10 , 5 , here , it is called interpreted KBC systems .KBC formulae are defined as \u03d5 : : = p | \u00ac \u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2227 \u03d5 | K\u03d5 | B\u03d5 | C\u03d5 .The epistemic relation \u223c vis is captured in the following way : r , i \u223c vis r ' , i ' iff Vis r i = Vis r ' i ' .The semantic clauses for belief and certainty are given below .Thus , an agent believes \u03d5 if , and only if , \u03d5 is true in all states which look like what he sees now and seem plausible in the current state .Certainty is stronger : if an agent is certain about \u03d5 , the formula must hold in all states with a visible part equal to the current perception , regardless of whether the invisible part is plausible or not .The logic does not include temporal formulae , although it might be extended with temporal operators , as time is already present in KBC models .In our approach , plausibility is explicitly seen as a temporal property , i.e. , it is a property of temporal paths rather than states .In the object language , this is reflected by the fact that plausibility assumptions are specified through path formulae .In contrast , the approach of 18 and 20 is static : not only the logics do not include operators for talking about time and/or change , but these are states that are assumed plausible or not in their semantics .The differences to 7 , 8 are more subtle .Firstly , the framework of Friedman and Halpern is static in the sense that plausibility is taken as a property of abstract possible worlds .This formulation is flexible enough to allow for incorporating time ; still , in our approach , time is inherent to plausibility rather than incidental .Secondly , our framework is more computationally oriented .The implementation of temporal plausibility in 7 , 8 is based on the interpreted systems approach with time points r , m being subject to plausibility .As runs are included in time points , they can also be defined plausible or implausible .7 However , it also means that time points serve the role of possible worlds in the basic formulation , which yields Kripke structures with uncountable possible world spaces in all but the most trivial cases .Thirdly , 7 , 8 build on linear time : a run more precisely , a time moment r , m is fixed when a formula is interpreted .In contrast , we use branching time with explicit quantification over temporal paths .8 We believe that branching time is more suitable for non-deterministic domains cf. e.g. 4 , of which multi-agent systems are a prime example .Note that branching time makes our notion of belief different from Friedman and Halpern 's .Most notably , property K\u03d5 \u2192 B\u03d5 is valid in their approach , but not in ours : an agent may 7Friedman and Halpern even briefly mention how plausibility of runs can be embedded in their framework .8To be more precise , time in 7 does implicitly branch at epistemic states .This is because r , m \u223c a r ' , m ' iff a 's local state corresponding to both time points is the same ra m = r ' a m ' .In consequence , the semantics of Ka\u03d5 can be read as `` for every run , and every moment on this run that yields the same local state as now , \u03d5 holds '' .know that some course of events is in principle possible , without believing that it can really become the case see Section 4.2 .As Proposition 13 suggests , such a subtle distinction between knowledge and beliefs is possible in our approach because branching time logics allow for existential quantification over runs .Fourthly , while Friedman and Halpern 's models are very flexible , they also enable system descriptions that may seem counterintuitive .Suppose that r , m is plausible in itself formally : r , m is minimal wrt ~ r , m , a , but r , m + 1 is not plausible in r , m + 1 .This means that following the plausible path makes it implausible cf. Remark 1 , which is even stranger in the case of linear time .Combining the argument with computational aspects , we suggest that our approach can be more natural and straightforward for many applications .Last but not least , our logic provides a mechanism for specifying and updating sets of plausible paths in the object language .Thus , plausibility sets can be specified in a succinct way , which is another feature that makes our framework computation-friendly .The model checking results from Section 5 are especially encouraging in this light .In this section we study some relevant properties of plausibility , knowledge , and beliefs ; in particular , axioms KDT45 are examined .But first , we identify two important subclasses of models with plausibility .A CTLKP model is plausibly serial or p-serial for agent a if every state of the system is part of a plausible path according to a , i.e. on \u03a5a = Q .As we will see further , a weaker requirement is sometimes sufficient .We call a model weakly p-serial if every state has at least one indistinguishable counterpart which lies on a plausible path , i.e. for each q \u2208 Q there is a q ~ \u2208 Q such that q \u223c a q ~ and q ~ \u2208 on \u03a5a .Obviously , p-seriality implies weak p-seriality .We get the following characterization of both model classes .PROPOSITION 4 .M is plausibly serial for agent a iff formula Pl aE 0 ~ is valid in M. M is weakly p-serial for agent a iff \u00ac KaPl aA 0 \u22a5 is valid in M.THEOREM 5 .Axioms K , D , 4 , and 5 for knowledge are strongly valid , and axiom T is valid .That is , modalities Ka form system S5 in the sense of normal validity , and KD45 in the sense of strong validity .We do not include proofs here due to lack of space .The interested reader is referred to 2 , where detailed proofs are given .PROPOSITION 6 .Axioms K , 4 , and 5 for beliefs are strongly valid .That is , we have :| \u2261 Ba\u03d5 \u2227 Ba \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8 \u2192 Ba\u03c8 , | \u2261 Ba\u03d5 \u2192 BaBa\u03d5 , and | \u2261 \u00ac Ba\u03d5 \u2192 Ba \u00ac Ba\u03d5 .The next proposition concerns the `` consistency '' axiom D : Ba\u03d5 \u2192 \u00ac Ba \u00ac \u03d5 .It is easy to see that the axiom is not valid in general : as we have no restrictions on plausibility sets \u03a5a , it may be as well that \u03a5a = \u2205 .In that case we have Ba\u03d5 \u2227 Ba \u00ac \u03d5 for all formulae \u03d5 , because the set of states to be considered becomes empty .However , it turns out that D is valid for a very natural class of models .PROPOSITION 7 .Axiom D for beliefs is not valid in the class of all CTLKP models .However , it is strongly valid in the class of weak p-serial models and therefore also in the class of p-serial models .Moreover , as one may expect , beliefs do not have to be always true .First , we investigate the relationship between knowledge and plausibility/physicality operators .Then , we look at the interaction between knowledge and beliefs .We now want to examine the relationship between knowledge and belief .For instance , if agent a believes in something , he knows that he believes it .Or , if he knows a fact , he also believes that he knows it .On the other hand , for instance , an agent does not necessarily believe in all the things he knows .For example , we may know that an invasion from another galaxy is in principle possible KaE \u2666 invasion , but if we do not take this possibility as plausible \u00ac Pl aE \u2666 invasion , then we reject the corresponding belief in consequence \u00ac BaE \u2666 invasion .Note that this property reflects the strong connection between belief and plausibility in our framework .The last invalidity is especially important : it is not the case that knowing something implies believing in it .This emphasizes that we study a specific concept of beliefs here .Note that its specific is not due to the plausibility-based definition of beliefs .The reason lies rather in the fact that we investigate knowledge , beliefs and plausibility in a temporal framework , as Proposition 12 shows .Moreover , it is important that we use branching time with explicit quantification over paths ; this observation is formalized in Proposition 13 .We call such \u03d5u universal formulae , and \u03b3u universal pathThe following two theorems characterize the relationship between knowledge and beliefs : first for the class of p-serial models , and then , finally , for all models .The first notable property of plausibility update is that it influences only formulae in which plausibility plays a role , i.e. ones in which belief or plausibility modalities occur .PROPOSITION 16 .Let \u03d5 be a CTLKP formula that does not include operators Pl a and Ba , and \u03b3 be a CTLKP path formula .Then , we have | \u2261 \u03d5 \u2194 set-pla \u03b3 \u03d5 .What can be said about the result of an update ?At first sight , formula set-pla \u03b3 Pl aA\u03b3 seems a natural characterization ; however , it is not valid .This is because , by leaving the other implausible paths out of scope , we may leave out of | \u03b3 | some paths that were needed to satisfy \u03b3 see the example in Section 4.2 .We propose two alternative ways out : the first one restricts the language of the update similarly to 21 ; the other refers to physical possibilities , in a way analogous to 13 .In this section we report preliminary results on model checking CTLKP formulae .Clearly , verifying CTLKP properties directly against models with plausibility does not make much sense , since these models are inherently infinite ; what we need is a finite representation of plausibility sets .One such representation has been discussed in Section 3.3 : plausibility sets can be defined by path formulae and the update operator set-pla \u03b3 .We follow this idea here , studying the complexity of model checking CTLKP formulae against CTLK models which can be seen as a compact representation of CTLKP models in which all the paths are assumed plausible , with the underlying idea that plausibility sets , when needed , must be defined explicitly in the object language .Below we sketch an algorithm that model-checks CTLKP formulae in time linear wrt the size of the model and the length of the formula .This means that we have extended CTLK to a more expressive language with no computational price to pay .First of all , we get rid of the belief operators due to Theorem 15 , replacing every occurrence of Ba\u03d5 with KaPl a E O ~ \u2192 \u03d5 .Now , let \u2192 \u2212 \u03b3 = ~ \u03b31 , ... , \u03b3k be a vector of `` vanilla '' path formulae one per agent , with the initial vector \u2212 \u03b30 \u2192 = ~ ~ , ... , ~ , and \u2192 \u2212 \u03b3 \u03b3 ' / a denoting vector \u2192 \u2212 \u03b3 , in which \u2192 \u2212 \u03b3 a is replaced with \u03b3 ' .Additionally , we define \u2192 \u2212 \u03b3 0 = ~ .We translate the resulting CTLKP formulae to ones without plausibility via function tr \u03d5 = tr \u2212 \u2192 \u03b30 ,0 \u03d5 , defined as follows :Note that the resulting sentences belong to the logic of CTLK + , that is CTL + where each path quantifier can be followed by a Boolean combination of `` vanilla '' path formulae 9 with epistemic modalities .The following proposition justifies the translation .PROPOSITION 18 .For any CTLKP formula \u03d5 without Ba , we have that M , q | = CTLKP \u03d5 iff M , q | = CTLK + tr \u03d5 .In general , model checking CTL + and also CTLK + is \u0394P2 complete .However , in our case , the Boolean combinations of path subformulae are always conjunctions of at most two non-negated elements , which allows us to propose the following model checking algorithm .First , subformulae are evaluated recursively : for every subformula \u03c8 of \u03d5 , the set of states in M that satisfy \u03c8 is computed and labeled with a new proposition p\u03c8 .Now , it is enough to define checking M , q | = \u03d5 for \u03d5 in which all state subformulae are propositions , with the following cases : Case M , q | = E \u2751 p \u2227 \u03b3 : If M , q | = p , then return no .Otherwise , remove from M all the states that do not satisfy p yielding a sparser model M ' , and check the CTL formula E\u03b3 in M ' , q with any CTL model-checker .Case M , q | = E Op \u2227 \u03b3 : Create M ' by adding a copy q ' of state q , in which only the transitions to states satisfying p are kept i.e. , M , q ' | = r iff M , q | = r ; and q ' Rq ' ' iff qRq ' ' and M , q ' ' | = p .Then , check E\u03b3 in M ' , q ' .Case M , q | = E p1U p2 \u2227 p3U p4 : Note that this is equivalent to checking E p1 \u2227 p3 U p2 \u2227 Ep3U p4 \u2228 E p1 \u2227 p3 U p4 \u2227 Ep1U p2 , which is a CTL formula .Other cases : The above cases cover all possible formulas that begin with a path quantifier .For other cases , standard CTLK model checking can be used .THEOREM 19 .Model checking CTLKP against CTLK models is PTIME-complete , and can be done in time O ml , where m is the number of transitions in the model , and l is the length of the formula to be checked .That is , the complexity is no worse than for CTLK itself .", "conclusions": "In this paper a notion of plausible behavior is considered , with the underlying idea that implausible options should be usually ignored in practical reasoning about possible future courses of action .We add the new notion of plausibility to the logic of CTLK 19 , and obtain a language which enables reasoning about what can or must plausibly happen .As a technical device to define the semantics of the resulting logic , we use a non-standard satisfaction relation | =P that allows to propagate the `` current '' set of plausible paths into subformulae .Furthermore , we propose a non-standard notion of beliefs , defined in terms of indistinguishability and plausibility .We also propose how plausibility assumptions can be specified in the object language via a plausibility update operator in a way similar to 13 .We use this new framework to investigate some important properties of plausibility , knowledge , beliefs , and updates .In particular , we show that knowledge is an S5 modality , and that beliefs satisfy axioms K45 in general , and KD45 for the class of plausibly serial models .We also prove that believing in \u03d5 is knowing that \u03d5 plausibly holds in all plausibly possible situations .That is , the relationship between knowledge and beliefs is very natural and reflects the initial intuition precisely .Moreover , the model checking results from Section 5 show that verification for CTLKP is no more complex than for CTL and CTLK .We would like to stress that we do not see this contribution as a mere technical exercise in formal logic .Human agents use a similar concept of plausibility and `` practical '' beliefs in their everyday reasoning in order to reduce the search space and make the reasoning feasible .As a consequence , we suggest that the framework we propose may prove suitable for modeling , design , and analysis resource-bounded agents in general .We would like to thank Juergen Dix for fruitful discussions , useful comments and improvements ."}
