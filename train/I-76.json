Bi or Si represents an utterance of B or S in the i-th round .B1 : I want to buy a personal computer of the brand b1 , with the specification of CPU :1 GHz , Memory :512 MB , HDD : 80GB , and a DVD-RW driver .I want to get it at the price under 1200 USD .S1 : We can provide a PC with the requested specification if you pay for it by cash .In this case , however , service points are not added for this special discount .B2 : I can not pay it by cash .S2 : In a normal price , the requested PC costs 1300 USD .B3 : I can not accept the price .My budget is under 1200 USD .S3 : We can provide another computer with the requested specification , except that it is made by the brand b2 .The price is exactly 1200 USD .B4 : I do not want a PC of the brand b2 .Instead , I can downgrade a driver from DVD-RW to CD-RW in my initial proposal .S4 : Ok , I accept your offer .In this dialogue , in response to the opening proposal B1 , the counter-proposal S1 is returned .In the rest of the dialogue , B2 , B3 , S4 are critiques , while S2 , S3 , B4 are counterproposals .Critiques are produced by evaluating a proposal in a knowledge base of an agent .In contrast , making counter-proposals involves generating an alternative proposal which is more favorable to the responding agent than the original one .It is known that there are two ways of producing counterproposals : extending the initial proposal or amending part of the initial proposal .According to 13 , the first type appears in the dialogue : A : `` I propose that you provide me with service X '' .B : `` I propose that I provide you with service X if you provide me with service Z '' .The second type is in the dialogue : A : `` I propose that I provide you with service Y if you provide me with service X '' .B : `` I propose that I provide you with service X if you provide me with service Z '' .A negotiation proceeds by iterating such `` give-andtake '' dialogues until it reaches an agreement/disagreement .In those dialogues , agents generate counter proposals by reasoning on their own goals or objectives .The objective of the agent A in the above dialogues is to obtain service X .The agent B proposes conditions to provide the service .In the process of negotiation , however , it may happen that agents are obliged to weaken or change their initial goals to reach a negotiated compromise .In the dialogue ofa buyer agent and a seller agent presented above , a buyer agent changes its initial goal by downgrading a driver from DVD-RW to CD-RW .Such behavior is usually represented as specific meta-knowledge of an agent or specified as negotiation protocols in particular problems .Currently , there is no computational logic for automated negotiation which has general inference rules for producing counter proposals .The purpose of this paper is to mechanize a process of building counter proposals in one-to-one negotiation dialogues .We suppose an agent who has a knowledge base represented by a logic program .We then introduce methods for generating three different types of proposals .First , we use the technique of extended abduction in artificial intelligence 8 , 15 to construct a conditional proposal as an extension of the original one .Second , we use the technique of relaxation in cooperative query answering for databases 4 , 6 to construct a neighborhood proposal as an amendment of the original one .Third , combining extended abduction and relaxation , conditional neighborhood proposals are constructed as amended extensions of the original proposal .We develop a negotiation protocol between two agents based on the exchange of these counter-proposals and critiques .We also provide procedures for computing proposals in logic programming .This paper is organized as follows .Section 2 introduces a logical framework used in this paper .Section 3 presents methods for constructing proposals , and provides a negotiation protocol .Section 4 provides methods for computing proposals in logic programming .Section 5 discusses related works , and Section 6 concludes the paper .", "title": "Negotiation by Abduction and Relaxation", "author_keywords_stem": ["negotiation", "extend abduction", "relaxation", "logic program"], "background": "Logic programs considered in this paper are extended disjunctive programs EDP 7 .An EDP or simply a program is a set of rules of the form :n \u2265 m \u2265 l \u2265 0 where each Li is a positive/negative literal , i.e. , A or \u00ac A for an atom A , and not is negation as failure NAF .not L is called an NAF-literal .The symbol `` ; '' represents disjunction .The left-hand side of the rule is the head , and the right-hand side is the body .For each rule r of the above form , head r , body + r and body r denote the sets of literals L1 , ... , Ll , Ll +1 , ... , Lm , and Lm +1 , ... , Ln , respectively .Also , not body r denotes the set of NAF-literals not Lm +1 , ... , not Ln .A disjunction of literals and a conjunction of NAF literals in a rule are identified with its corresponding sets of literals .A rule r is often written as head r \u2190 body + r , not body r or head r \u2190 body r where body r = body + r \u222a not body r .A rule r is disjunctive if head r contains more than one literal .A rule r is an integrity constraint if head r = \u2205 ; and r is a fact if body r = \u2205 .A program is NAF-free if no rule contains NAF-literals .Two rules/literals are identified with respect to variable renaming .A substitution is a mapping from variables to terms 0 = x1/t1 , ... , xn/tn , where x1 , ... , xn are distinct variables and each ti is a term distinct from xi .Given a conjunction G of NAF literals , G0 denotes the conjunction obtained by applying 0 to G .A program , rule , or literal is ground if it contains no variable .A program P with variables is a shorthand of its ground instantiation Ground P , the set of ground rules obtained from P by substituting variables in P by elements of its Herbrand universe in every possible way .The semantics of an EDP is defined by the answer set semantics 7 .Let Lit be the set of all ground literals in the language of a program .Suppose a program P and a set of literals S \u2286 Lit .Then , the reduct P S is the program which contains the ground rule head r \u2190 body + r iff there is a rule r in Ground P such that body r \u2229 S = \u2205 .Given an NAF-free EDP P , Cn P denotes the smallest set of ground literals which is i closed under P , i.e. , for every ground rule r in Ground P , body r \u2286 Cn P implies head r \u2229 Cn P = ~ \u2205 ; and ii logically closed , i.e. , it is either consistent or equal to Lit .Given an EDP P and a set S of literals , S is an answer set of P if S = Cn P S .A program has none , one , or multiple answer sets in general .An answer set is consistent if it is not Lit .A program P is consistent if it has a consistent answer set ; otherwise , P is inconsistent .Abductive logic programming 9 introduces a mechanism of hypothetical reasoning to logic programming .An abductive framework used in this paper is the extended abduction introduced by Inoue and Sakama 8 , 15 .An abductive program is a pair P , H where P is an EDP and H is a set of literals called abducibles .When a literal L \u2208 H contains variables , any instance of L is also an abducible .An abductive program P , H is consistent if P is consistent .Throughout the paper , abductive programs are assumed to be consistent unless stated otherwise .Let G = L1 , ... , Lm , not Lm +1 , ... , not Ln be a conjunction , where all variables in G are existentially quantified at the front and range-restricted , i.e. , every variable in Lm +1 , ... , Ln appears in L1 , ... , Lm .A set S of ground literals satisfies the conjunction G if L10 , ... , Lm0 \u2286 S and Lm +10 , ... , Ln0 \u2229 S = \u2205 for some ground instance G0 with a substitution 0 .Let P , H be an abductive program and G a conjunction as above .A pair E , F is an explanation of an observationgram P , H satisfying G with respect to E , F .Note that if P has a consistent answer set S satisfying G , S is also a belief set of P , H satisfying G with respect to E , F = \u2205 , \u2205 .Extended abduction introduces/removes hypotheses to/from a program to explain an observation .Note that `` normal '' abduction as in 9 considers only introducing hypotheses to explain an observation .An explanation E , F of an observation G is called minimal if for any explanation E ' , F ' of G , E ' \u2286 E and F ' \u2286 F imply E ' = E and F ' = F.", "abstract": "This paper studies a logical framework for automated negotiation between two agents .We suppose an agent who has a knowledge base represented by a logic program .Then , we introduce methods of constructing counter-proposals in response to proposals made by an agent .To this end , we combine the techniques of extended abduction in artificial intelligence and relaxation in cooperative query answering for databases .These techniques are respectively used for producing conditional proposals and neighborhood proposals in the process of negotiation .We provide a negotiation protocol based on the exchange of these proposals and develop procedures for computing new proposals .", "id": "I-76", "combined_keywords_stem": ["autom negoti", "multi-agent system", "on-to-on negoti", "altern propos", "specif meta-knowledg", "condit propos", "abduct framework", "abduct program", "drop condit", "anti-instanti", "induct gener", "minim explan", "integr constraint", "negoti", "extend abduct", "relax", "logic program"], "combined_keywords": ["automated negotiation", "multi-agent system", "one-to-one negotiation", "alternative proposal", "specific meta-knowledge", "conditional proposal", "abductive framework", "abductive program", "dropping condition", "anti-instantiation", "inductive generalization", "minimal explanation", "integrity constraint", "negotiation", "extend abduction", "relaxation", "logic program"], "author_keywords": ["negotiation", "extend abduction", "relaxation", "logic program"], "method": "We suppose an agent who has a knowledge base represented by an abductive program P , H .A program P consists of two types of knowledge , belief B and desire D , where B represents objective knowledge of an agent , while D represents subjective knowledge in general .We define P = B U D , but do not distinguish B and D if such distinction is not important in the context .In contrast , abducibles H are used for representing permissible conditions to make a compromise in the process of negotiation .where every variable in G is existentially quantified at the front and range-restricted .In particular , G is called a critique if G = accept or G = reject where accept and reject are the reserved propositions .A counter-proposal is a proposal made in response to a proposal .DEFINITION 3.2 .A proposal G is accepted in an abductive program P , H if P has an answer set satisfying G .When a proposal is not accepted , abduction is used for seeking conditions to make it acceptable .DEFINITION 3.3 .Let P , H be an abductive program and G a proposal .If E , F is a minimal explanation of G\u03b8 for some substitution \u03b8 in P , H , the conjunction G ' :PROOF .When G ' = G\u03b8 , E , not F , P \\ F U E has a consistent answer set S satisfying G\u03b8 and E n F = 0 .In this case , S satisfies G\u03b8 , E , not F .A conditional proposal G ' provides a minimal requirement for accepting the proposal G .If G\u03b8 has multiple minimal explanations , several conditional proposals exist accordingly .When E , F = ~ 0 , 0 , a conditional proposal is used as a new proposal made in response to the proposal G. EXAMPLE 3.1 .An agent seeks a position of a research assistant at the computer department of a university with the condition that the salary is at least 50,000 USD per year .The agent makes his/her request as the proposal :22For notational convenience , we often include mathematical in equations in proposals/programs .They are written by literals , for instance , x > y by geq x , y with a suitable definition of the predicate geq .where available positions are represented by disjunction .According to P , the base salary of a research assistant at the computer department is 40,000 USD , but if he/she has PhD , it is 60,000 USD .In this case , E , F = has PhD1 , 0 becomes the minimal explanation of G\u03b8 = assist compt dept , salary 60 , 000 with \u03b8 = x/60 , 000 1 .Then , the conditional proposal made by the university becomes assist compt dept , salary 60 , 000 , has PhD .When a proposal is unacceptable , an agent tries to construct a new counter-proposal by weakening constraints in the initial proposal .We use techniques of relaxation for this purpose .Relaxation is used as a technique of cooperative query answering in databases 4 , 6 .When an original query fails in a database , relaxation expands the scope of the query by relaxing the constraints in the query .This allows the database to return `` neighborhood '' answers which are related to the original query .We use the technique for producing proposals in the process of negotiation .DEFINITION 3.4 .Let P , H be an abductive program and G a proposal .Then , G is relaxed to G ' in the following three ways : Anti-instantiation : Construct G ' such that G ' \u03b8 = G for some substitution \u03b8 .Dropping conditions : Construct G ' such that G ' C G. Goal replacement : If G is a conjunction `` G1 , G2 '' , where G1 and G2 are conjunctions , and there is a rule L + G ' 1 in P such that G ' 1\u03b8 = G1 for some substitution \u03b8 , then build G ' as L\u03b8 , G2 .Here , L\u03b8 is called a replaced literal .In each case , every variable in G ' is existentially quantified at the front and range-restricted .Anti-instantiation replaces constants or terms with fresh variables .Dropping conditions eliminates some conditions in a proposal .Goal replacement replaces the condition G1 in G with a literal L\u03b8 in the presence of a rule L + G ' 1 in P under the condition G ' 1\u03b8 = G1 .All these operations generalize proposals in different ways .Each G ' obtained by these operations is called a relaxation of G .It is worth noting that these operations are also used in the context of inductive generalization 12 .The relaxed proposal can produce new offers which are neighbor to the original proposal .DEFINITION 3.5 .Let P , H be an abductive program and G a proposal .3 .Let G ~ be a proposal obtained by goal replacement .For a replaced literal L E G ~ and a rule H < B in P such that L = Hor and G ~ \\ L U Bor = ~ G for some substitution or , put G ~ ~ = G ~ \\ L U Bor .If P has an answer set S which satisfies G ~ ~ 0 for some substitution 0 , G ~ ~ 0 is called a neighborhood proposal by goal replacement .EXAMPLE 3.2 .cont .Example 3.1 Given the proposal G = assist compt dept , salary x , x > 50 , 000 ,with 01 = w/math dept is satisfied by an answer set of P , G ~ 101 becomes a neighborhood proposal by anti-instantiation .with 02 = x/40 , 000 is satisfied by an answer set of P , G ~ 202 becomes a neighborhood proposal by dropping conditions .with 03 = x/55 , 000 is satisfied by an answer set of P , G ~ ~ 3 03 becomes a neighborhood proposal by goal replacement .Finally , extended abduction and relaxation are combined to produce conditional neighborhood proposals .DEFINITION 3.6 .Let P , H be an abductive program and G a proposal .Suppose G ~ ~ as in Definition 3.5 3 .If E , F is a minimal explanation of G ~ ~ 0 for some substitution 0 , the conjunction G ~ ~ 0 , E , not F is called a conditional neighborhood proposal by goal replacement .A conditional neighborhood proposal reduces to a neighborhood proposal when E , F = 0 , 0 .A negotiation protocol defines how to exchange proposals in the process of negotiation .This section presents a negotiation protocol in our framework .We suppose one-to-one negotiation between two agents who have a common ontology and the same language for successful communication .Integrity constraints are conditions which an agent should satisfy , so that they are used to explain why an agent does not accept a proposal .A negotiation proceeds in a series of rounds .Each i-th round i > 1 consists of a proposal Gi1 made by one agent Ag1 and another proposal Gi2 made by the other agent Ag2 .DEFINITION 3.8 .Let P1 , H1 be an abductive program of an agent Ag1 and Gi2 a proposal made by Ag2 at the i-th round .A critique set of Ag1 at the i-th round is a setconstraint in P1 and Gj2 violates r where j = i \u2212 1 or i , and CS01 P1 , G02 = CS11 P1 , G02 = 0 .A critique set of an agent Ag1 accumulates integrity constraints which are violated by proposals made by another agent Ag2 .CSi2 P2 , Gj 1 is defined in the same manner .DEFINITION 3.9 .Let Pk , Hk be an abductive program of an agent Agk and Gj a proposal , which is not a critique , made by any agent at the j < i th round .A negotiation set of Agk at the i-th round is a triple NSik = Sic , Si n , Sicn , where Sic is the set of conditional proposals , Sin is the set of neighborhood proposals , and Sicn is the set of conditional neighborhood proposals , produced by Gj and Pk , Hk .A negotiation set represents the space of possible proposals made by an agent .Six x E c , n , cn accumulates proposals produced by Gj 1 < j < i according to Definitions 3.3 , 3.5 , and 3.6 .Note that an agent can construct counter-proposals by modifying its own previous proposals or another agent 's proposals .An agent Agk accumulates proposals that are made by Agk but are rejected by another agent , in the failed proposal set FPki at the i-th round , where FPk0 = 0 .Suppose two agents Ag1 and Ag2 who have abductive programs P1 , H1 and P2 , H2 , respectively .Given a proposal G11 which is satisfied by an answer set of P1 , a negotiation starts .In response to the proposal Gi1 made by Ag1 at the i-th round , Ag2 behaves as follows .p satisfies the constraints in CSi1 P1 , Gi \u2212 1 2 .If \u03bc Sic = ~ 0 , select one from \u03bc Sic and propose it as Gi2 to Ag1 ; otherwise , go to ii .In the step 4 a , Ag2 rejects the proposal Gi1 and returns the reason of rejection as a critique set .This helps for Ag1in preparing a next counter-proposal .In the step 4 b , Ag2 constructs a new proposal .In its construction , Ag2 should take care of the critique set CSi 1 P1 , Gi-1 2 , which represents integrity constraints , if any , accumulated in previous rounds , that Ag1 must satisfy .Also , FP2i is used for removing proposals which have been rejected .Construction of Six x E c , n , cn in NSi2 is incrementally done by adding new counter-proposals produced by Gi1 or Gi-12 to Si-1 x .For instance , Sin in NSi2 is computed aswhere S0n = 0 .That is , Sin is constructed from Si-1 n by adding new proposals which are obtained by modifying the proposal Gi1 made by Ag1 at the i-th round or modifying the proposal Gi-1 2 made by Ag2 at the i \u2212 1 th round .Sic and Sicn are obtained as well .In the above protocol , an agent produces Sic at first , secondly Si n , and finally Sicn .This strategy seeks conditions which satisfy the given proposal , prior to neighborhood proposals which change the original one .Another strategy , which prefers neighborhood proposals to conditional ones , is also considered .Conditional neighborhood proposals are to be considered in the last place , since they differ from the original one to the maximal extent .The above protocol produces the candidate proposals in Six for each x E c , n , cn at once .We can consider a variant of the protocol in which each proposal in Six is constructed one by one see Example 3.3 .The above protocol is repeatedly applied to each one of the two negotiating agents until a negotiation ends in success/failure .Formally , the above negotiation protocol has the following properties .THEOREM 3.2 .Let Ag1 and Ag2 be two agents having abductive programs P1 , H1 and P2 , H2 , respectively .PROOF .1 .When an abductive program is function-free , abducibles and negotiation sets are both finite .Moreover , if a proposal is once rejected , it is not proposed again by the function \u03bc .Thus , negotiation will terminate in finite steps .2 .When a proposal G is made by Ag1 , P1 , H1 has a belief set satisfying G .If the agent Ag2 accepts the proposal G , it is satisfied by an answer set of P2 which is also a belief set of P2 , H2 .Here , 1 and 2 represent selection of products .The atom pc b1 , 1G , 512M , 80G represents that the seller agent has a PC of the brand b1 such that CPU is 1GHz , memory is 512MB , and HDD is 80GB .Prices of products are represented as desire of the seller .The rules 3 5 are normal prices of products .A normal price is a selling price on the condition that service points are added 6 .On the other hand , a discount price is applied if the paying method is cash and no service point is added 7 .The fact 8 represents the addition of service points .This service would be withdrawn in case of discount prices , so add point is specified as an abducible .A buyer agent has the abductive program Pb , Hb in which Pb consists of belief Bb and desire Db :and 16 impose constraints for buying a PC .A DVD-RW is specified as an abducible which is subject to concession .1st round First , the following proposal is given by the buyer agent :As Ps has no answer set which satisfies G1b , the seller agent can not accept the proposal .The seller takes an action of making a counter-proposal and performs abduction .As a result , the seller finds the minimal explanation E , F = pay cash , add point which explains G1b01 with 01 = x/1170 .The seller constructs the conditional proposal : G1s : pc b1 , 1G , 512M , 80G , dvd-rw , price 1170 , pay cash , not add point and offers it to the buyer .2nd round The buyer does not accept G1s because he/she can not pay it by cash 15 .The buyer then returns the critique G2b = reject to the seller , together with the critique set CS2 b Pb , G1 s = 15 .In response to this , the seller tries to make another proposal which satisfies the constraint in this critique set .As G1s is stored in FPs2 and no other conditional proposal satisfying the buyer 's requirement exists , the seller produces neighborhood proposals .He/she relaxes G1b by dropping x < 1200 in the condition , and produces pc b1 , 1G , 512M , 80G , dvd-rw , price x .As Ps has an answer set which satisfies G2s : pc b1 , 1G , 512M , 80G , dvd-rw , price 1300 ,the seller offers G2s as a new counter-proposal .3rd round The buyer does not accept G2s because he/she can not pay more than 1200USD 16 .The buyer again returns the critique G3b = reject to the seller , together with the critique set CS3b Pb , G2s = CS2b Pb , G1s U 16 .The seller then considers another proposal by replacing b1 with a variable w , G1b now becomesthe seller offers G3s as a new counter-proposal .4th round The buyer does not accept G3s because a PC of the brand b2 is out of his/her interest and Pb has no answer set satisfying G3s .Then , the buyer makes a concession by changing his/her original goal .The buyer relaxes G1b by goal replacement using the rule 9 in Pb , and produces pc b1 , 1G , 512M , 80G , drive , price x , x < 1200 .Using 10 , the following proposal is produced : pc b1 , 1G , 512M , 80G , cd-rw , price x , x < 1200 .As Pb \\ dvd-rw has a consistent answer set satisfying the above proposal , the buyer proposes the conditional neighborhood proposalto the seller agent .Since Ps also has an answer set satisfying G4b , the seller accepts it and sends the message G4s = accept to the buyer .Thus , the negotiation ends in success .In this section , we provide methods of computing proposals in terms of answer sets of programs .We first introduce some definitions from 15 .DEFINITION 4.1 .Given an abductive program P , H , the set UR of update rules is defined as :where L , + L , and \u2212 L are new atoms uniquely associated with every L E H .The atoms + L and \u2212 L are called update atoms .By the definition , the atom L becomes true iff L is not true .The pair of rules L \u2190 not L and L \u2190 not L specify the situation that an abducible L is true or not .When p x E H and p a E P but p t E P for t = a , the rule + L \u2190 L precisely becomes + p t \u2190 p t for any t = a .In this case , the rule is shortly written as + p x \u2190 p x , x = a. Generally , the rule becomes + p x \u2190 p x , x = t1 , ... , x = tn for n such instances .The rule + L \u2190 L derives the atom + L if an abducible L which is not in P is to be true .In contrast , the rule \u2212 L \u2190 not L derives the atom \u2212 L if an abducible L which is in P is not to be true .Thus , update atoms represent the change of truth values of abducibles in a program .That is , + L means the introduction of L , while \u2212 L means the deletion of L .When an abducible L contains variables , the associated update atom + L or \u2212 L is supposed to have exactly the same variables .In this case , an update atom is semantically identified with its ground instances .The set of all update atoms associated with the abducibles in H is denoted by UH , and UH = UH + U UH where UH + resp .UH is the set of update atoms of the form + L resp .\u2212 L .DEFINITION 4.2 .Given an abductive program P , H , its update program UP is defined as the programAn answer set S of UP is called U-minimal if there is no answer set T of UP such that T n UH \u2282 S n UH .By the definition , U-minimal answer sets exist whenever UP has answer sets .Update programs are used for computing minimal explanations of an observation .Given an observation G as a conjunction of literals and NAF-literals possibly containing variables , we introduce a new ground literal O together with the rule O \u2190 G .In this case , O has an explanation E , F iff G has the same explanation .With this replacement , an observation is assumed to be a ground literal without loss of generality .In what follows , E + = + L | L E E and F = \u2212 L | L E F for E \u2286 H and F \u2286 H.Next , consider the program UP U \u2190 not flies t .It has the single U-minimal answer set : S = bird t , bird o , f lies t , flies o , broken-wing t , broken-wing o , \u2212 broken-wing t .The unique minimal explanation E , F = 0 , broken-wing t of G is expressed by the update atom \u2212 broken-wing t in S n UH .P U O + G , H with a ground literal O. Compute a minimal explanation of O in P U O + G , H using its update program .If O has a minimal explanation E , F with a substitution 0 for variables in G , put `` G0 , E , not F '' in S. .Next , neighborhood proposals are computed as follows .input : an abductive program P , H , a proposal G ;

Thus , they use relaxation for weakening the constraints in an abductive logic program .In contrast , we use relaxation for weakening proposals and three different relaxation methods , anti-instantiation , dropping conditions , and goal replacement , are considered .Their goal is to explain an observation by revising integrity constraints of an agent through communication , while we use integrity constraints for communication to explain critiques and help other agents in making counter-proposals .Meyer et al. 11 introduce a logical framework for negotiating agents .They introduce two different modes of negotiation : concession and adaptation .They provide rational postulates to characterize negotiated outcomes between two agents , and describe methods for constructing outcomes .They provide logical conditions for negotiated outcomes to satisfy , but they do not describe a process of negotiation nor negotiation protocols .Moreover , they represent agents by classical propositional theories , which is different from our abductive logic programming framework .Foo et al. 5 model one-to-one negotiation as a one-time encounter between two extended logic programs .An agent offers an answer set of its program , and their mutual deal is regarded as a trade on their answer sets .Starting from the initial agreement set SnT for an answer set S of an agent and an answer set T of another agent , each agent extends this set to reflect its own demand while keeping consistency with demand of the other agent .Their algorithm returns new programs having answer sets which are consistent with each other and keep the agreement set .The work is extended to repeated encounters in 3 .In their framework , two agents exchange answer sets to produce a common belief set , which is different from our framework of exchanging proposals .There are a number of proposals for negotiation basedon argumentation .An advantage of argumentation-based negotiation is that it constructs a proposal with arguments supporting the proposal 1 .The existence of arguments is useful to convince other agents of reasons why an agent offers counter proposals or returns critiques .Parsons et al. 13 develop a logic of argumentation-based negotiation among BDI agents .In one-to-one negotiation , an agent A generates a proposal together with its arguments , and passes it to another agent B .The proposal is evaluated by B which attempts to build arguments against it .If it conflicts with B 's interest , B informs A of its objection by sending back its attacking argument .In response to this , A tries to find an alternative way of achieving its original objective , or a way of persuading B to drop its objection .If either type of argument can be found , A will submit it to B .If B finds no reason to reject the new proposal , it will be accepted and the negotiation ends in success .Otherwise , the process is iterated .In this negotiation processes , the agent A never changes its original objective , so that negotiation ends in failure if A fails to find an alternative way of achieving the original objective .In our framework , when a proposal is rejected by another agent , an agent can weaken or change its objective by abduction and relaxation .Our framework does not have a mechanism of argumentation , but reasons for critiques can be informed by responding critique sets .Kakas and Moraitis 10 propose a negotiation protocol which integrates abduction within an argumentation framework .A proposal contains an offer corresponding to the negotiation object , together with supporting information representing conditions under which this offer is made .Supporting information is computed by abduction and is used for constructing conditional arguments during the process of negotiation .In their negotiation protocol , when an agent can not satisfy its own goal , the agent considers the other agent 's goal and searches for conditions under which the goal is acceptable .Our present approach differs from theirs in the following points .First , they use abduction to seek conditions to support arguments , while we use abduction to seek conditions for proposals to accept .Second , in their negotiation protocol , counter-proposals are chosen among candidates based on preference knowledge of an agent at meta-level , which represents policy under which an agent uses its object-level decision rules according to situations .In our framework , counter-proposals are newly constructed using abduction and relaxation .The method of construction is independent of particular negotiation protocols .As 2 , 10 , 14 , abduction or abductive logic programming used in negotiation is mostly based on normal abduction .In contrast , our approach is based on extended abduction which can not only introduce hypotheses but remove them from a program .This is another important difference .Relaxation and neighborhood query answering are devised to make databases cooperative with their users 4 , 6 .In this sense , those techniques have the spirit similar to cooperative problem solving in multi-agent systems .As far as the authors know , however , there is no study which applies those technique to agent negotiation ."}
