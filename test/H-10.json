more attentions as an important and fundamental technique for unsupervised document organization , automatic topic extraction , and fast information retrieval or filtering .A good document clustering approach can assist the computers to automatically organize the document corpus into a meaningful cluster hierarchy for efficient browsing and navigation , which is very valuable for complementing the deficiencies of traditional information retrieval technologies .As pointed out by 8 , the information retrieval needs can be expressed by a spectrum ranged from narrow keyword-matching based search to broad information browsing such as what are the major international events in recent months .Traditional document retrieval engines tend to fit well with the search end of the spectrum , i.e. they usually provide specified search for documents matching the user 's query , however , it is hard for them to meet the needs from the rest of the spectrum in which a rather broad or vague information is needed .In such cases , efficient browsing through a good cluster hierarchy will be definitely helpful .Generally , document clustering methods can be mainly categorized into two classes : hierarchical methods and partitioning methods .The hierarchical methods group the data points into a hierarchical tree structure using bottom-up or top-down approaches .For example , hierarchical agglomerative clustering HAC 13 is a typical bottom-up hierarchical clustering method .It takes each data point as a single cluster to start off with and then builds bigger and bigger clusters by grouping similar data points together until the entire dataset is encapsulated into one final cluster .On the other hand , partitioning methods decompose the dataset into a number of disjoint clusters which are usually optimal in terms of some predefined criterion functions .For instance , K-means 13 is a typical partitioning method which aims to minimize the sum of the squared distance between the data points and their corresponding cluster centers .In this paper , we will focus on the partitioning methods .As we know that there are two main problems existing in partitioning methods like Kmeans and Gaussian Mixture Model GMM 16 : 1 the predefined criterion is usually non-convex which causes many local optimal solutions ; 2 the iterative procedure e.g. the Expectation Maximization EM algorithm for optimizing the criterions usually makes the final solutions heavily depend on the initializations .In the last decades , many methods have been proposed to overcome the above problems of the partitioning methods 19 28 .Recently , another type of partitioning methods based on clustering on data graphs have aroused considerable interests in the machine learning and data mining community .The basic idea behind these methods is to first model the whole dataset as a weighted graph , in which the graph nodes represent the data points , and the weights on the edges correspond to the similarities between pairwise points .Then the cluster assignments of the dataset can be achieved by optimizing some criterions defined on the graph .For example Spectral Clustering is one kind of the most representative graph-based clustering approaches , it generally aims to optimize some cut value e.g. Normalized Cut 22 , Ratio Cut 7 , Min-Max Cut 11 defined on an undirected graph .After some relaxations , these criterions can usually be optimized via eigen-decompositions , which is guaranteed to be global optimal .In this way , spectral clustering efficiently avoids the problems of the traditional partitioning methods as we introduced in last paragraph .In this paper , we propose a novel document clustering algorithm that inherits the superiority of spectral clustering , i.e. the final cluster results can also be obtained by exploit the eigen-structure of a symmetric matrix .However , unlike spectral clustering , which just enforces a smoothness constraint on the data labels over the whole data manifold 2 , our method first construct a regularized linear label predictor for each data point from its neighborhood as in 25 , and then combine the results of all these local label predictors with a global label smoothness regularizer .So we call our method Clustering with Local and Global Regularization CLGR .The idea of incorporating both local and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning 31 , and our experimental evaluations on several real document datasets show that CLGR performs better than many state-of-the-art clustering methods .The rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we will introduce our CLGR algorithm in detail .The experimental results on several datasets are presented in section 3 , followed by the conclusions and discussions in section 4 .", "evaluation": "In this section , experiments are conducted to empirically compare the clustering results of CLGR with other 8 representitive document clustering algorithms on 5 datasets .First we will introduce the basic informations of those datasets .We use a variety of datasets , most of which are frequently used in the information retrieval research .Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the datasets .4Here an indication matrix T is a n \u00d7 c matrix with its i , j th entry Tij 0 , 1 such that for each row of Q * there is only one 1 .Then the xi can be assigned to the j-th cluster such that j = argjQ * ij = 1 .Input :CSTR .This is the dataset of the abstracts of technical reports published in the Department of Computer Science at a university .The dataset contained 476 abstracts , which were divided into four research areas : Natural Language Processing NLP , Robotics/Vision , Systems , and Theory .WebKB .The WebKB dataset contains webpages gathered from university computer science departments .There are about 8280 documents and they are divided into 7 categories : student , faculty , staff , course , project , department and other .The raw text is about 27MB .Among these 7 categories , student , faculty , course and project are four most populous entity-representing categories .The associated subset is typically called WebKB4 .Reuters .The Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Test collection contains documents collected from the Reuters newswire in 1987 .It is a standard text categorization benchmark and contains 135 categories .In our experiments , we use a subset of the data collection which includes the 10 most frequent categories among the 135 topics and we call it Reuters-top 10 .WebACE .The WebACE dataset was from WebACE project and has been used for document clustering 17 5 .The WebACE dataset contains 2340 documents consisting news articles from Reuters new service via the Web in October 1997 .These documents are divided into 20 classes .News4 .The News4 dataset used in our experiments are selected from the famous 20-newsgroups dataset5 .The topic rec containing autos , motorcycles , baseball and hockey was selected from the version 20news-18828 .The News4 dataset contains 3970 document vectors .To pre-process the datasets , we remove the stop words using a standard stop list , all HTML tags are skipped and all header fields except subject and organization of the posted articles are ignored .In all our experiments , we first select the top 1000 words by mutual information with class labels .In the experiments , we set the number of clusters equal to the true number of classes C for all the clustering algorithms .To evaluate their performance , we compare the clusters generated by these algorithms with the true classes by computing the following two performance measures .Clustering Accuracy Acc .The first performance measure is the Clustering Accuracy , which discovers the one-toone relationship between clusters and classes and measures the extent to which each cluster contained data points from the corresponding class .It sums up the whole matching degree between all pair class-clusters .Clustering accuracy can be computed as :where Ck denotes the k-th cluster in the final results , and Lm is the true m-th class .T Ck , Lm is the number of entities which belong to class m are assigned to cluster k. Accuracy computes the maximum sum of T Ck , Lm for all pairs of clusters and classes , and these pairs have no overlaps .The greater clustering accuracy means the better clustering performance .Normalized Mutual Information NMI .Another evaluation metric we adopt here is the Normalized Mutual Information NMI 23 , which is widely used for determining the quality of clusters .For two random variable X and Y , the NMI is defined as :where I X , Y is the mutual information between X and Y , while H X and H Y are the entropies of X and Y respectively .One can see that NMI X , X = 1 , which is the maximal possible value of NMI .Given a clustering result , the NMI in Eq .30 is estimated as where nk denotes the number of data contained in the cluster Ck 1 S k S C , \u02c6nm is the number of data belonging to the m-th class 1 S m S C , and nk , m denotes the number of data that are in the intersection between the cluster Ck and the m-th class .The value calculated in Eq .31 is used as a performance measure for the given clustering result .The larger this value , the better the clustering performance .We have conducted comprehensive performance evaluations by testing our method and comparing it with 8 other representative data clustering methods using the same data corpora .The algorithms that we evaluated are listed below .For computational efficiency , in the implementation of CPLR and our CLGR algorithm , we have set all the local regularization parameters i n i = 1 to be identical , which is set by grid search from 0.1 , 1 , 10 .The size of the k-nearest neighborhoods is set by grid search from 20 , 40 , 80 .For the CLGR method , its global regularization parameter is set by grid search from 0.1 , 1 , 10 .When constructing the global regularizer , we have adopted the local scaling method 30 to construct the Laplacian matrix .The final discretization method adopted in these two methods is the same as in 26 , since our experiments show that using such method can achieve better results than using kmeans based methods as in 20 .The clustering accuracies comparison results are shown in table 3 , and the normalized mutual information comparison results are summarized in table 4 .From the two tables we mainly observe that :has been proved theoretically in 10 .It can be observed from the tables that NMF and Spectral Clustering usually lead to similar clustering results .5 .The co-clustering based methods TNMF and ASI can usually achieve better results than traditional purely document vector based methods .Since these methods perform an implicit feature selection at each iteration , provide an adaptive metric for measuring the neighborhood , and thus tend to yield better clustering results .6 .The results achieved from CPLR are usually better than the results achieved from Spectral Clustering , which supports Vapnik 's theory 24 that sometimes local learning algorithms can obtain better results than global learning algorithms .Besides the above comparison experiments , we also test the parameter sensibility of our method .There are mainly two sets of parameters in our CLGR algorithm , the local and global regularization parameters Ai n i = 1 and A , as we have said in section 3.3 , we have set all Ai 's to be identical to A * in our experiments , and the size of the neighborhoods .Therefore we have also done two sets of experiments : 1 .Fixing the size of the neighborhoods , and testing the clustering performance with varying A * and A .In this set of experiments , we find that our CLGR algorithm can achieve good results when the two regularization parameters are neither too large nor too small .Typically our method can achieve good results when A * and A are around 0.1 .Figure 1 shows us such a testing example on the WebACE dataset .2 .Fixing the local and global regularization parameters , and testing the clustering performance with differentsizes of neighborhoods .In this set of experiments , we find that the neighborhood with a too large or too small size will all deteriorate the final clustering results .This can be easily understood since when the neighborhood size is very small , then the data points used for training the local classifiers may not be sufficient ; when the neighborhood size is very large , the trained classifiers will tend to be global and can not capture the typical local characteristics .Figure 2 shows us a testing example on the WebACE dataset .Therefore , we can see that our CLGR algorithm 1 can achieve satisfactory results and 2 is not very sensitive to the choice of parameters , which makes it practical in real world applications .", "method": "In this section , we will introduce our Clustering with Local and Global Regularization CLGR algorithm in detail .First let 's see the how the documents are represented throughout this paper .In our work , all the documents are represented by the weighted term-frequency vectors .Let W = w1 , w2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , wm be the complete vocabulary set of the document corpus which is preprocessed by the stopwords removal and words stemming operations .The term-frequency vector xi of document di is defined aswhere tik is the term frequency of wk W , n is the size of the document corpus , idfk is the number of documents that contain word wk .In this way , xi is also called the TFIDF representation of document di .Furthermore , we also normalize each xi 1 S i S n to have a unit length , so that each document is represented by a normalized TF-IDF vector .As its name suggests , CLGR is composed of two parts : local regularization and global regularization .In this subsection we will introduce the local regularization part in detail .As we know that clustering is one type of learning techniques , it aims to organize the dataset in a reasonable way .Generally speaking , learning can be posed as a problem of function estimation , from which we can get a good classification function that will assign labels to the training dataset and even the unseen testing dataset with some cost minimized 24 .For example , in the two-class classification scenario1 in which we exactly know the label of each document , a linear classifier with least square fit aims to learn a column vector w such that the squared costis minimized , where yi +1 , \u2212 1 is the label of xi .By taking J / w = 0 , we get the solutionwhere X = x1 , x2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xn is an m \u00d7 n document matrix , y = y1 , y2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yn T is the label vector .Then for a test document t , we can determine its label by l = sign w * T u , 4 where sign \u00b7 is the sign function .A natural problem in Eq .3 is that the matrix XXT may be singular and thus not invertable e.g. when m n .To avoid such a problem , we can add a regularization term and minimize the following criterionwhere is a regularization parameter .Then the optimal solution that minimize J' is given bywhere I is an m \u00d7 m identity matrix .It has been reported that the regularized linear classifier can achieve very good results on text classification problems 29 .However , despite its empirical success , the regularized linear classifier is on earth a global classifier , i.e. w * is estimated using the whole training set .According to 24 , this may not be a smart idea , since a unique w * may not be good enough for predicting the labels of the whole input space .In order to get better predictions , 6 proposed to train classifiers locally and use them to classify the testing points .For example , a testing point will be classified by the local classifier trained using the training points located in the vicinity 1In the following discussions we all assume that the documents coming from only two classes .The generalizations of our method to multi-class cases will be discussed in section 2.5 .of it .Although this method seems slow and stupid , it is reported that it can get better performances than using a unique global classifier on certain tasks 6 .Inspired by their success , we proposed to apply the local learning algorithms for clustering .The basic idea is that , for each document vector xi 1 S i S n , we train a local label predictor based on its k-nearest neighborhood Ni , and then use it to predict the label of xi .Finally we will combine all those local predictors by minimizing the sum of their prediction errors .In this subsection we will introduce how to construct those local predictors .Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the regularized linear classifier that we have introduced in section 2.2.1 , we choose it to be our local label predictor , such that for each document xi , the following criterion is minimizedwhere ni = | Ni | is the cardinality of Ni , and qj is the cluster membership of xj .Then using Eq .6 , we can get the optimal solution iswhere Xi = xi1 , xi2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xini , and we use xik to denote the k-th nearest neighbor of xi .qi = qi1 , qi2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , qini T with qik representing the cluster assignment of xik .The problem here is that XiXTi is an m \u00d7 m matrix with m ni , i.e. we should compute the inverse of an m \u00d7 m matrix for every document vector , which is computationally prohibited .Fortunately , we have the following theorem : Theorem 1 .w i in Eq .8 can be rewritten aswhere Ii is an ni \u00d7 ni identity matrix .Using theorem 1 , we only need to compute the inverse of an ni \u00d7 ni matrix for every document to train a local label predictor .Moreover , for a new testing point u that falls into Ni , we can classify it by the sign ofThis is an attractive expression since we can determine the cluster assignment of u by using the inner-products between the points in u Ni , which suggests that such a local regularizer can easily be kernelized 21 as long as we define a proper kernel function .After all the local predictors having been constructed , we will combine them together by minimizingwhich stands for the sum of the prediction errors for all the local predictors .Combining Eq .10 with Eq .6 , we can getwhere q = q1 , q2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , qn T , and the P is an n \u00d7 n matrix constructing in the following way .Let \u2212 1 = xTi Xi XTi Xi + iniIi , then aij , if xj Ni Pij = 0 , otherwise , 12 where Pij is the i , j th entry of P , and aij represents the j-th entry of ai .Till now we can write the criterion of clustering by combining locally regularized linear label predictors Jl in an explicit mathematical form , and we can minimize it directly using some standard optimization techniques .However , the results may not be good enough since we only exploit the local informations of the dataset .In the next subsection , we will introduce a global regularization criterion and combine it with Jl , which aims to find a good clustering result in a local-global way .In data clustering , we usually require that the cluster assignments of the data points should be sufficiently smooth with respect to the underlying data manifold , which implies 1 the nearby points tend to have the same cluster assignments ; 2 the points on the same structure e.g. submanifold or cluster tend to have the same cluster assignments 31 .Without the loss of generality , we assume that the data points reside roughly on a low-dimensional manifold M2 , and q is the cluster assignment function defined on M , i.e. 2We believe that the text data are also sampled from some low dimensional manifold , since it is impossible for them tofor x M , q x returns the cluster membership of x .The smoothness of q over M can be calculated by the following Dirichlet integral 2 fwhere the gradient q is a vector in the tangent space TMx , and the integral is taken with respect to the standard measure on M .If we restrict the scale of q by q , q M = 1 where \u00b7 , \u00b7 M is the inner product induced on M , then it turns out that finding the smoothest function minimizing D q reduces to finding the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator L , which is defined as Lq A \u2212 div q , 14 where div is the divergence of a vector field .Generally , the graph can be viewed as the discretized form of manifold .We can model the dataset as an weighted undirected graph as in spectral clustering 22 , where the graph nodes are just the data points , and the weights on the edges represent the similarities between pairwise points .Then it can be shown that minimizing Eq .13 corresponds to minimizingwhere q = q1 , q2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , qn T with qi = q xi , L is the graph Laplacian with its i , j th entry di \u2212 wii , if i = j \u2212 wij , if xi and xj are adjacent 16 0 , otherwise , where di = Ej wij is the degree of xi , wij is the similarity between xi and xj .If xi and xj are adjacent3 , wij is usually computed in the following waywhere v is a dataset dependent parameter .It is proved that under certain conditions , such a form of wij to determine the weights on graph edges leads to the convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace Beltrami operator 3 18 .In summary , using Eq .15 with exponential weights can effectively measure the smoothness of the data assignments with respect to the intrinsic data manifold .Thus we adopt it as a global regularizer to punish the smoothness of the predicted data assignments .Combining the contents we have introduced in section 2.2 and section 2.3 we can derive the clustering criterion is minq J = Jl + AJg = Pq \u2212 q 2 + AqT Lqwhere P is defined as in Eq .12 , and A is a regularization parameter to trade off Jl and Jg .However , the discrete fill in the whole high-dimensional sample space .And it has been shown that the manifold based methods can achieve good results on text classification tasks 31 .3In this paper , we define xi and xj to be adjacent if xi N xj or xj N xi .constraint of pi makes the problem an NP hard integer programming problem .A natural way for making the problem solvable is to remove the constraint and relax qi to be continuous , then the objective that we aims to minimize becomesand we further add a constraint qT q = 1 to restrict the scale of q .Then our objective becomesUsing the Lagrangian method , we can derive that the optimal solution q corresponds to the smallest eigenvector of the matrix M = P \u2212 I T P \u2212 I + AL , and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by the sign of qi , i.e. xi will be classified as class one if qi > 0 , otherwise it will be classified as class 2 .In the above we have introduced the basic framework of Clustering with Local and Global Regularization CLGR for the two-class clustering problem , and we will extending it to multi-class clustering in this subsection .First we assume that all the documents belong to C classes indexed by L = 1 , 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , C .qc is the classification function for class c 1 S c S C , such that qc xi returns the confidence that xi belongs to class c .Our goal is to obtain the value of qc xi 1 S c S C , 1 S i S n , and the cluster assignment of xi can be determined by qc xi Cc = 1 using some proper discretization methods that we will introduce later .Therefore , in this multi-class case , for each document xi 1 S i S n , we will construct C locally linear regularized label predictors whose normal vectors are \u2212 1 wc * i = Xi XTi Xi + AiniIi qci 1 S c S C , 21 where Xi = xi1 , xi2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xini with xik being the k-th neighbor of xi , and qci = qci1 , qci2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , qcini T with qcik = qc xik .Then wc * i T xi returns the predicted confidence of xi belonging to class c. Hence the local prediction error for class c can be defined asAnd the total local prediction error becomesAs in Eq .11 , we can define an n \u00d7 n matrix P see Eq .12 and rewrite Jl as Pqc \u2212 qc 2 .24 Similarly we can define the global smoothness regularizerin multi-class case as qc T Lqc .25 Then the criterion to be minimized for CLGR in multi-class case becomeswhere Q = q1 , q2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , qc is an n \u00d7 c matrix , and trace \u00b7 returns the trace of a matrix .The same as in Eq .20 , we also add the constraint that QT Q = I to restrict the scale of Q .Then our optimization problem becomesFrom the Ky Fan theorem 28 , we know the optimal solution of the above problem iswhere q * k 1 S k S C is the eigenvector corresponds to the k-th smallest eigenvalue of matrix P \u2212 I T P \u2212 I + AL , and R is an arbitrary C \u00d7 C matrix .Since the values of the entries in Q * is continuous , we need to further discretize Q * to get the cluster assignments of all the data points .There are mainly two approaches to achieve this goal : 1 .As in 20 , we can treat the i-th row of Q as the embedding of xi in a C-dimensional space , and apply some traditional clustering methods like kmeans to clustering these embeddings into C clusters .2 .Since the optimal Q * is not unique because of the existence of an arbitrary matrix R , we can pursue an optimal R that will rotate Q * to an indication matrix4 .The detailed algorithm can be referred to 26 .The detailed algorithm procedure for CLGR is summarized in table 1 .", "title": "Regularized Clustering for Documents *", "author_keywords_stem": ["document cluster", "regular"]}
