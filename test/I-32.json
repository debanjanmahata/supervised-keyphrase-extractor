because individual agents hadlimited resources , or limited access to information e.g. , limited processing power , limited sensor coverage , they worked together by design to solve problems that individually they could not solve , or at least could not solve as efficiently .MAS research , however , soon began to consider interacting agents with individuated interests , as representatives of different humans or organizations with non-identical interests .When interactions are guided by diverse interests , participants may have to overcome disagreements , uncooperative interactions , and even intentional attempts to damage one another .When these types of interactions occur , environments require appropriate behavior from the agents situated in them .We call these environments Adversarial Environments , and call the clashing agents Adversaries .Models of cooperation and teamwork have been extensively explored in MAS through the axiomatization of mental states e.g. , 8 , 4 , 5 .However , none of this research dealt with adversarial domains and their implications for agent behavior .Our paper addresses this issue by providing a formal , axiomatized mental state model for a subset of adversarial domains , namely simple zero-sum adversarial environments .Simple zero-sum encounters exist of course in various twoplayer games e.g. , Chess , Checkers , but they also exist in n-player games e.g. , Risk , Diplomacy , auctions for a single good , and elsewhere .In these latter environments especially , using a utility-based adversarial search such as the Min-Max algorithm does not always provide an adequate solution ; the payoff function might be quite complex or difficult to quantify , and there are natural computational limitations on bounded rational agents .In addition , traditional search methods like Min-Max do not make use of a model of the opponent , which has proven to be a valuable addition to adversarial planning 9 , 3 , 11 .In this paper , we develop a formal , axiomatized model for bounded rational agents that are situated in a zero-sum adversarial environment .The model uses different modality operators , and its main foundations are the SharedPlans 4 model for collaborative behavior .We explore environment properties and the mental states of agents to derive behavioral axioms ; these behavioral axioms constitute a formal model that serves as a specification and design guideline for agent design in such settings .We then investigate the behavior of our model empirically using the Connect-Four board game .We show that this game conforms to our environment definition , and analyze players ' behavior using a large set of completed match log", "evaluation": "The main purpose of our experimental analysis is to evaluate the model 's behavior and performance in a real adversarial environment .This section investigates whether bounded 1A case where following the completion of \u03b2 there exists a \u03b3 which gives high utility for Agent Auag , can not occur because Ao uses the same utility , and \u03b3 's existence will cause it to classify \u03b2 as a low utility action .rational agents situated in such adversarial environments will be better off applying our suggested behavioral axioms .To explore the use of the above model and its behavioral axioms , we decided to use the Connect-Four game as our adversarial environment .Connect-Four is a 2-player , zerosum game which is played using a 6x7 matrix-like board .Each turn , a player drops a disc into one of the 7 columns the set of 21 discs is usually colored yellow for player 1 and red for player 2 ; we will use White and Black respectively to avoid confusion .The winner is the first player to complete a horizontal , vertical , or diagonal set of four discs with its color .On very rare occasions , the game might end in a tie if all the empty grids are filled , but no player managed to create a 4-disc set .The Connect-Four game was solved in 1 , where it is shown that the first player playing with the white discs can force a win by starting in the middle column column 4 and playing optimally However , the optimal strategy is very complex , and difficult to follow even for complex bounded rational agents , such as human players .Before we can proceed checking agent behavior , we must first verify that the domain conforms to the adversarial environment 's definition as given above which the behavioral axioms are based on .First , when playing a Connect-Four game , the agent has an intention to win the game item 1 .Second item 2 , our agent believes that in Connect-Four there can only be one winner or no winner at all in the rare occurrence of a tie .In addition , our agent believes that its opponent to the game will try to win item 3 , and we hope it has some partial knowledge item 4 about its adversary this knowledge can vary from nothing , through simple facts such as age , to strategies and weaknesses .Of course , not all Connect-Four encounters are adversarial .For example , when a parent is playing the game with its child , the following situation might occur : the child , having a strong incentive to win , treats the environment as adversarial it intends to win , understands that there can only be one winner , and believes that its parent is trying to beat him .However , the parent 's point of view might see the environment as an educational one , where its goal is not to win the game , but to cause enjoyment or practice strategic reasoning .In such an educational environment , a new set of behavioral axioms might be more beneficial to the parent 's goals than our suggested adversarial behavioral axioms .After showing that the Connect-Four game is indeed a zero-sum , bilateral adversarial environment , the next step is to look at players ' behaviors during the game and check whether behaving according to our model does improve performance .To do so we have collected log files from completed Connect-Four games that were played by human players over the Internet .Our collected log file data came from Play by eMail PBeM sites .These are web sites that host email games , where each move is taken by an email exchange between the server and the players .Many such sites ' archives contain real competitive interactions , and also maintain a ranking system for their members .Most of the data we used can be found in 6 .As can be learned from 1 , Connect-Four has an optimal strategy and a considerable advantage for the player who starts the game which we call the White player .We will concentrate in our analysis on the second player 's moves to be called Black .The White player , being the first to act , has the so-called initiative advantage .Having the advantage and a good strategy will keep the Black player busy reacting to its moves , instead of initiating threats .A threat is a combination of three discs of the same color , with an empty spot for the fourth winning disk .An open threat is a threat that can be realized in the opponent 's next move .In order for the Black player to win , it must somehow turn the tide , take the advantage and start presenting threats to the White player .We will explore Black players ' behavior and their conformance to our axioms .To do so , we built an application that reads log files and analyzes the Black player 's moves .The application contains two main components : 1 a Min-Max algorithm for evaluation of moves ; 2 open threats detector for the discovering of open threats .The Min-Max algorithm will work to a given depth , d and for each move \u03b1 will output the heuristic value for the next action taken by the player as written in the log file , h \u03b1 , alongside the maximum heuristic value , maxh \u03b1 , that could be achieved prior to taking the move obviously , if h \u03b1 = ~ maxh \u03b1 , then the player did not do the optimal move heuristically .The threat detector 's job is to notify if some action was taken in order to block an open threat not blocking an open threat will probably cause the player to lose in the opponent 's next move .The heuristic function used by Min-Max to evaluate the player 's utility is the following function , which is simple to compute , yet provides a reasonable challenge to human opponents : Definition 8 .Let Group be an adjacent set of four squares that are horizontal , vertical , or diagonal .Groupn b Groupn w be a Group with n pieces of the black white color and 4 \u2212 n empty squares .The values of \u03b1 , ,3 and 5 can vary to form any desired linear combination ; however , it is important to value them with the \u03b1 < ,3 < 5 ordering in mind we used 1 , 4 , and 8 as their respective values .Groups of 4 discs of the same color means victory , thus discovery of such a group will result in \u221e to ensure an extreme value .We now use our estimated evaluation function to evaluate the Black player 's actions during the Connect-Four adversarial interaction .Each game from the log file was input into the application , which processed and output a reformatted log file containing the h value of the current move , the maxh value that could be achieved , and a notification if an open threat was detected .A total of 123 games were analyzed 57 with White winning , and 66 with Black winning .A few additional games were manually ignored in the experiment , due to these problems : a player abandoning the game while the outcome is not final , or a blunt irrational move in the early stages of the game e.g. , not blocking an obvious winning group in the first opening moves .In addition , a single tie game was also removed .The simulator was run to a search depth of 3 moves .We now proceed to analyze the games with respect to each behavioral axiom .The following section presents the heuristic evaluations of the Min-Max algorithm for each action , and checks the amount and extent of suboptimal tactical actions and their implications on performance .Table 1 shows results and insights from the games ' heuristic analysis , when search depth equals 3 this search depth was selected for the results to be comparable to 9 , see Section 3.2.3 .The table 's heuristic data is the difference between the present maximal heuristic value and the heuristic value of the action that was eventually taken by the player i.e. , the closer the number is to 0 , the closer the action was to the maximum heuristic action .The first row presents the difference values of the action that had the maximal difference value among all the Black player 's actions in a given game , as averaged over all Black 's winning and losing games see respective columns .In games in which the Black player loses , its average difference value was -17.62 , while in games in which the Black player won , its average was -12.02 .The second row expands the analysis by considering the 3 highest heuristic difference actions , and averaging them .In that case , we notice an average heuristic difference of 5 points between games which the Black player loses and games in which it wins .Nevertheless , the importance of those numbers is that they allowed us to take an educated guess on a threshold number of 11.5 , as the value of the TrH constant , which differentiates between normal actions and highly beneficial ones .After finding an approximated TrH constant , we can proceed with an analysis of the importance of suboptimal moves .To do so we took the subset of games in which the minimum heuristic difference value for Black 's actions was 11.5 .As presented in Table 2 , we can see the different min3h average of the 3 largest ranges and the respective percentage of games won .The first row shows that the Black player won only 12 % of the games in which the average of its 3 highest heuristically difference actions min3h was smaller than the suggested threshold , TrH = 11.5 .The second row shows a surprising result : it seems that when min3h > 4 the Black player rarely wins .Intuition would suggest that games in which the action evaluation values were closer to the maximal values will result in more winning games for Black .However , it seems that in the Connect-Four domain , merely responding with somewhat easily expected actions , without initiating a few surprising and suboptimal moves , does not yield good results .The last row sums up the main insights from the analysis ; most of Black 's wins 83 % came when its min3h was in the range of -11.5 to -4 .A close inspection of those Black winning games shows the following pattern behind the numbers : after standard opening moves , Black suddenly drops a disc into an isolated column , which seems a waste of a move .White continues to build its threats , while usually disregarding Black 's last move , which in turn uses the isolated disc as an anchor for a future winning threat .The results show that it was beneficial for the Black playerto take suboptimal actions and not give the current highest possible heuristic value , but will not be too harmful for its position i.e. , will not give high beneficial value to its adversary .As it turned out , learning the threshold is an important aspect of success : taking wildly risky moves min3h < 11.5 or trying to avoid them min3h > 4 reduces the Black player 's winning chances by a large margin .In the task of showing the importance of monitoring one 's adversaries ' profiles , our log files could not be used because they did not contain repeated interactions between players , which are needed to infer the players ' knowledge about their adversaries .However , the importance of opponent modeling and its use in attaining tactical advantages was already studied in various domains 3 , 9 are good examples .In a recent paper , Markovitch and Reger 9 explored the notion of learning and exploitation of opponent weakness in competitive interactions .They apply simple learning strategies by analyzing examples from past interactions in a specific domain .They also used the Connect-Four adversarial domain , which can now be used to understand the importance of monitoring the adversary 's profile .Following the presentation of their theoretical model , they describe an extensive empirical study and check the agent 's performance after learning the weakness model with past examples .One of the domains used as a competitive environment was the same Connect-Four game Checkers was the second domain .Their heuristic function was identical to ours with three different variations H1 , H2 , and H3 that are distinguished from one another in their linear combination coefficient values .The search depth for the players was 3 as in our analysis .Their extensive experiments check and compare various learning strategies , risk factors , predefined feature sets and usage methods .The bottom line is that the Connect-Four domain shows an improvement from a 0.556 winning rate before modeling to a 0.69 after modeling page 22 .Their conclusions , showing improved performance when holding and using the adversary 's model , justify the effort to monitor the adversary profile for continuous and repeated interactions .An additional point that came up in their experiments is the following : after the opponent weakness model has been learned , the authors describe different methods of integrating the opponent weakness model into the agent 's decision strategy .Nevertheless , regardless of the specific method they chose to work with , all integration methods might cause the agent to take suboptimal decisions ; it might cause the agent to prefer actions that are suboptimal at the present decision junction , but which might cause the opponent to react in accordance with its weakness model as represented by our agent which in turn will be beneficial for us in the future .The agent 's behavior , as demonstrated in 9 further confirms and strengthens our Suboptimal Tactical Axiom as discussed in the previous section .The need for the Goal Achieving , Preventive Act , and Evaluation Maximization axioms are obvious , and need no further verification .However , even with respect to those axioms , a few interesting insights came up in the log analysis .The Goal achieving and Preventive Act axioms , though theoretically trivial , seem to provide some challenge to a human player .In the initial inspection of the logs , we encountered few games2 where a player , for inexplicable reasons , did not block the other from winning or failed to execute its own winning move .We can blame those faults on the human 's lack of attention , or a typing error in its move reply ; nevertheless , those errors might occur in bounded rational agents , and the appropriate behavior needs to be axiomatized .A typical Connect-Four game revolves around generating threats and blocking them .In our analysis we looked for explicit preventive actions , i.e. , moves that block a group of 3 discs , or that remove a future threat in our limited search horizon .We found that in 83 % of the total games there was at least one preventive action taken by the Black player .It was also found that Black averaged 2.8 preventive actions per game on the games in which it lost , while averaging 1.5 preventive actions per game when winning .It seems that Black requires 1 or 2 preventive actions to build its initial taking position , before starting to present threats .If it did not manage to win , it will usually prevent an extra threat or two before succumbing to White .", "method": "files .In addition , we use the results presented in 9 to discuss the importance of opponent modeling in our ConnectFour adversarial domain .The paper proceeds as follows .Section 2 presents the model 's formalization .Section 3 presents the empirical analysis and its results .We discuss related work in Section 4 , and conclude and present future directions in Section 5 .The adversarial environment model denoted as AE is intended to guide the design of agents by providing a specification of the capabilities and mental attitudes of an agent in an adversarial environment .We focus here on specific types of adversarial environments , specified as follows :We will work on both bilateral and multilateral instantiations of zero-sum and simple environments .In particular , our adversarial environment model will deal with interactions that consist of N agents N > 2 , where all agents are adversaries , and only one agent can succeed .Examples of such environments range from board games e.g. , Chess , Connect-Four , and Diplomacy to certain economic environments e.g. , N-bidder auctions over a single good .Our approach is to formalize the mental attitudes and behaviors of a single adversarial agent ; we consider how a single agent perceives the AE .The following list specifies the conditions and mental states of an agent in a simple , zero-sum AE :Item 3 is required , since it might be the case that some agent has a full conflicting goal , and is currently considering adopting the intention to complete it , but is , as of yet , not committed to achieving it .This might occur because the agent has not yet deliberated about the effects that adopting that intention might have on the other intentions it is currently holding .In such cases , it might not consider itself to even be in an adversarial environment .Item 4 states that the agent should hold some belief about the profiles of its adversaries .The profile represents all the knowledge the agent has about its adversary : its weaknesses , strategic capabilities , goals , intentions , trustworthiness , and more .It can be given explicitly or can be learned from observations of past encounters .We use Grosz and Kraus 's definitions of the modal operators , predicates , and meta-predicates , as defined in their SharedPlan formalization 4 .We recall here some of the predicates and operators that are used in that formalization : Int.To Ai , \u03b1 , Tn , T\u03b1 , C represents Ai 's intentions at time Tn to do an action \u03b1 at time T\u03b1 in the context of C. Int.Th Ai , prop , Tn , Tprop , C represents Ai 's intentions at time Tn that a certain proposition prop holds at time Tprop in the context of C .The potential intention operators , Pot.Int.To ... and Pot.Int.Th ... , are used to represent the mental state when an agent considers adopting an intention , but has not deliberated about the interaction of the other intentions it holds .The operator Bel Ai , f , Tf represents agent Ai believing in the statement expressed in formula f , at time Tf .MB A , f , Tf represents mutual belief for a group of agents A .A snapshot of the system finds our environment to be in some state e E E of environmental variable states , and each adversary in any LAi E L of possible local states .At any given time step , the system will be in some world w of the set of all possible worlds w E W , where w = E xLA1 xLA2 x ... LAn , and n is the number of adversaries .For example , in a Texas Hold 'em poker game , an agent 's local state might be its own set of cards which is unknown to its adversary while the environment will consist of the betting pot and the community cards which are visible to both players .A utility function under this formalization is defined as a mapping from a possible world w E W to an element in R , which expresses the desirability of the world , from a single agent perspective .We usually normalize the range to 0,1 , where 0 represents the least desirable possible world , and 1 is the most desirable world .The implementation of the utility function is dependent on the domain in question .The following list specifies new predicates , functions , variables , and constants used in conjunction with the original definitions for the adversarial environment formalization :Ai is true when agent Ai holds an object profile for agent Aj .function returning a value which represents the amount ofknowledge agent Ai has on the profile of agent Aj , at time Tn .The higher the value , the more knowledge agent Ai has .AdvKnow : PAj Ai \u00d7 Tn \u2192 ~ Definition 3 .Eval This evaluation function returns an estimated expected utility value for an agent in A , after completing an action from CA in some world state w. Eval : A \u00d7 CA \u00d7 w \u2192 ~ Definition 4 .TrH Threshold is a numerical constant in the 0,1 range that represents an evaluation function Eval threshold value .An action that yields an estimated utility evaluation above the TrH is regarded as a highly beneficial action .The Eval value is an estimation and not the real utility function , which is usually unknown .Using the real utility value for a rational agent would easily yield the best outcome for that agent .However , agents usually do not have the real utility functions , but rather a heuristic estimate of it .There are two important properties that should hold for the evaluation function : Property 1 .The evaluation function should state that the most desirable world state is one in which the goal is achieved .Therefore , after the goal has been satisfied , there can be no future action that can put the agent in a world state with higher Eval value .\u2200 Ai , G * Ai , \u03b1 , ,3 \u2208 CAi , w \u2208 W Achieve G * Ai , \u03b1 , w \u21d2 Eval Ai , \u03b1 , w \u2265 Eval Ai , ,3 , w Property 2 .The evaluation function should project an action that causes a completion of a goal or a subgoal to a value which is greater than TrH a highly beneficial action .Definition 5 .SetAction We define a set action SetAction as a set of action operations either complex or basic actions from some action sets CAi and CAj which , according to agent Ai 's belief , are attached together by a temporal and consequential relationship , forming a chain of events action , and its following consequent action .The consequential relation might exist due to various environmental constraints when one action forces the adversary to respond with a specific action or due to the agent 's knowledge about the profile of its adversary .Property 3 .As the knowledge we have about our adversary increases we will have additional beliefs about its behavior in different situations which in turn creates new set actions .Formally , if our AdvKnow at time Tn +1 is greater than AdvKnow at time Tn , then every SetAction known at time Tn is also known at time Tn +1 .Bel Aag , SetAction \u03b11 , ... , \u03b1u , ,31 , ... , ,3 v , Tn \u21d2 Bel Aag , SetAction \u03b11 , ... , \u03b1u , ,31 , ... , ,3 v , Tn +1The following axioms provide the formal definition for a simple , zero-sum Adversarial Environment AE .Satisfaction of these axioms means that the agent is situated in such an environment .It provides specifications for agent Aag to interact with its set of adversaries A with respect to goals G * Aag and G * A at time TCo at some world state w. AE Aag , A , G * Aag , A1 , ... , Ak , G * A1 , ... , G * Ak , Tn , wTo build an agent that will be able to operate successfully within such an AE , we must specify behavioral guidelines for its interactions .Using a naive Eval maximization strategy to a certain search depth will not always yield satisfactory results for several reasons : 1 the search horizon problem when searching for a fixed depth ; 2 the strong assumption of an optimally rational , unbounded resources adversary ; 3 using an estimated evaluation function which will not give optimal results in all world states , and can be exploited 9 .The following axioms specify the behavioral principles that can be used to differentiate between successful and less successful agents in the above Adversarial Environment .Those axioms should be used as specification principles when designing and implementing agents that should be able to perform well in such Adversarial Environments .The behavioral axioms represent situations in which the agent will adopt potential intentions to Pot.Int.To ... perform an action , which will typically require some means-end reasoning to select a possible course of action .This reasoning will lead to the adoption of an Int.To ... see 4 .This somewhat trivial behavior is the first and strongest axiom .In any situation , when the agent is an action away from completing the goal , it should complete the action .Any fair Eval function would naturally classify \u03b1 as the maximal value action property 1 .However , without explicit axiomatization of such behavior there might be situations where the agent will decide on taking another action for various reasons , due to its bounded decision resources .A2 .Preventive Act Axiom .Being in an adversarial situation , agent Aag might decide to take actions that will damage one of its adversary 's plans to complete its goal , even if those actions do not explicitly advance Aag towards its conflicting goal G * Aag .Such preventive action will take place when agent Aag has a belief about the possibility of its adversary Ao doing an action ,3 that will give it a highutility evaluation value > TrH .Believing that taking action \u03b1 will prevent the opponent from doing its ,3 , it will adopt a potential intention to do \u03b1 .This axiom is a basic component of any adversarial environment .For example , looking at a Chess board game , a player could realize that it is about to be checkmated by its opponent , thus making a preventive move .Another example is a Connect Four game : when a player has a row of three chips , its opponent must block it , or lose .A specific instance of A1 occurs when the adversary is one action away from achieving its goal , and immediate preventive action needs to be taken by the agent .Formally , we have the same beliefs as stated above , with a changed belief that doing action ,3 will cause agent Ao to achieve its goal .Sketch of proof : Proposition 1 can be easily derived from axiom A1 and the property 2 of the Eval function , which states that any action that causes a completion of a goal is a highly beneficial action .The preventive act behavior will occur implicitly when the Eval function is equal to the real world utility function .However , being bounded rational agents and dealing with an estimated evaluation function we need to explicitly axiomatize such behavior , for it will not always occur implicitly from the evaluation function .A3 .Suboptimal Tactical Move Axiom .In many scenarios a situation may occur where an agent will decide not to take the current most beneficial action it can take the action with the maximal utility evaluation value , because it believes that taking another action with lower utility evaluation value might yield depending on the adversary 's response a future possibility for a highly beneficial action .This will occur most often when the Eval function is inaccurate and differs by a large extent from the Utility function .Put formally , agent Aag believes in a certain SetAction that will evolve according to its initial action and will yield a high beneficial value > TrH solely for it .An agent might believe that a chain of events will occur for various reasons due to the inevitable nature of the domain .For example , in Chess , we often observe the following : a move causes a check position , which in turn limits the opponent 's moves to avoiding the check , to which the first player might react with another check , and so on .The agent might also believe in a chain of events based on its knowledge of its adversary 's profile , which allows it to foresee the adversary 's movements with high accuracy .For example , going back to the Chess board game scenario , consider starting a game versus an opponent about whom we know nothing , not even if it is a human or a computerized opponent .We might start playing a strategy that will be suitable versus an average opponent , and adjust our game according to its level of play .A5 .Alliance Formation Axiom The following behavioral axiom is relevant only in a multilateral instantiation of the adversarial environment obviously , an alliance can not be formed in a bilateral , zero-sum encounter .In different situations during a multilateral interaction , a group of agents might believe that it is in their best interests to form a temporary alliance .Such an alliance is an agreement that constrains its members ' behavior , but is believed by its members to enable them to achieve a higher utility value than the one achievable outside of the alliance .As an example , we can look at the classical Risk board game , where each player has an individual goal of being the sole conquerer of the world , a zero-sum game .However , in order to achieve this goal , it might be strategically wise to make short-term ceasefire agreements with other players , or to join forces and attack an opponent who is stronger than the rest .An alliance 's terms defines the way its members should act .It is a set of predicates , denoted as Terms , that is agreed upon by the alliance members , and should remain true for the duration of the alliance .For example , the set Terms in the Risk scenario , could contain the following predicates :The set Terms specifies inter-group constraints on each of the alliance member 's VAali E Aal C A set of actions Cal i C C.threshold ; above it , the alliance can be said to be a highly beneficial alliance .The value of Al TrH will be calculated dynamically according to the progress of the interaction , as can be seen in 7 .After an alliance is formed , its members are now working in their normal adversarial environment , as well as according to the mental states and axioms required for their interactions as part of the alliance .The following Alliance model AL specifies the conditions under which the group Aal can be said to be in an alliance and working with a new and constrained set of actions Cal , at time Tn .MB Aal , VAali E Aal Al val Aali , Cal , Aal , w > Al TrH , Tn Members ' profiles are a crucial part of successful alliances .We assume that agents that have more accurate profiles of their adversaries will be more successful in such environments .Such agents will be able to predict when a member is about to breach the alliance 's contract item 2 in the above model , and take counter measures when item 3 will falsify .The robustness of the alliance is in part a function of its members ' trustfulness measure , objective position estimation , and other profile properties .We should note that an agent can simultaneously be part of more than one alliance .Such a temporary alliance , where the group members do not have a joint goal but act collaboratively for the interest of their own individual goals , is classified as a Treatment Group by modern psychologists 12 in contrast to a Task Group , where its members have a joint goal .The Shared Activity model as presented in 5 modeled Treatment Group behavior using the same SharedPlans formalization .When comparing both definitions of an alliance and a Treatment Group we found an unsurprising resemblance between both models : the environment model 's definitions are almost identical see SA 's definitions in 5 , and their Selfish-Act and Cooperative Act axioms conform to our adversarial agent 's behavior .The main distinction between both models is the integration of a Helpful-behavior act axiom , in the Shared Activity which can not be part of ours .This axiom states that an agent will consider taking action that will lower its Eval value to a certain lower bound , if it believes that a group partner will gain a significant benefit .Such behavior can not occur in a pure adversarial environment as a zero-sum game is , where the alliance members are constantly on watch to manipulate their alliance to their own advantage .A6 .Evaluation Maximization Axiom .In a case when all other axioms are inapplicable , we will proceed with the action that maximizes the heuristic value as computed in the Eval function .T1 .Optimality on Eval = Utility The above axiomatic model handles situations where the Utility is unknown and the agents are bounded rational agents .The following theorem shows that in bilateral interactions , where the agents have the real Utility function i.e. , Eval = Utility and are rational agents , the axioms provide the same optimal result as classic adversarial search e.g. , Min-Max .THEOREM 1 .Let Aeag be an unbounded rational AE agent using the Eval heuristic evaluation function , Auag be the same agent using the true Utility function , and Ao be a sole unbounded utility-based rational adversary .Given that Eval = Utility :Sketch of proof Given that Auag has the real utility function and unbounded resources , it can generate the full game tree and run the optimal MinMax algorithm to choose the highest utility value action , which we denote by , \u03b1 .The proof will show that Aeag , using the AE axioms , will select the same or equal utility \u03b1 when there is more than one action with the same max utility when Eval = Utility .", "title": "An Adversarial Environment Model for Bounded Rational Agents in Zero-Sum Interactions", "author_keywords_stem": ["agent", "multiag system", "modal logic"], "related work": "Much research deals with the axiomatization of teamwork and mental states of individuals : some models use knowledge and belief 10 , others have models of goals and intentions 8 , 4 .However , all these formal theories deal with agent teamwork and cooperation .As far as we know , our model is the first to provide a formalized model for explicit adversarial environments and agents ' behavior in it .The classical Min-Max adversarial search algorithm was the first attempt to integrate the opponent into the search space with a weak assumption of an optimally playing opponent .Since then , much effort has gone into integrating the opponent model into the decision procedure to predict future behavior .The M \u2217 algorithm presented by Carmel and Markovitch 2 showed a method of incorporating opponent models into adversary search , while in 3 they used learning to provide a more accurate opponent model in a 2player repeated game environment , where agents ' strategies were modeled as finite automata .Additional Adversarial planning work was done by Willmott et al. 13 , which provided an adversarial planning approach to the game of GO .The research mentioned above dealt with adversarial search and the integration of opponent models into classical utilitybased search methods .That work shows the importance of opponent modeling and the ability to exploit it to an agent 's advantage .However , the basic limitations of those search methods still apply ; our model tries to overcome those limitations by presenting a formal model for a new , mental state-based adversarial specification ."}
