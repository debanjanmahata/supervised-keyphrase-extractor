Under anonymous VCG redistribution mechanism r , agent i 's redistribution equals r 0 \u2212 i , where 0 \u2212 i is the multiset of the types of the agents other than i.We use \u03b8 ~ to denote the type profile .Let V CG ~ \u03b8 be the total We organize existing results by their settings .VCG payment for this type profile .A VCG redistribution mechanism r satisfies the non-deficit property if the total redistribution never exceeds the total VCG payment .That is , for any type profile ~ \u03b8 , Ei r \u03b8 \u2212 i \u2264 V CG ~ \u03b8 .A VCG redistribution mechanism r is ex post individually rational if every agent 's final utility is always nonnegative .Since VCG is individually rational , we have that a sufficient condition for r to be individually rational is for any \u03b8 ~ and any i , r \u03b8 \u2212 i \u2265 0 on top of VCG , every agent also receives a redistribution amount that is always nonnegative .On the other hand , when agent i is not interested in any item her valuation on any item bundle equals 0 , under VCG , i 's utility always equals 0 .After redistribution , agent i 's utility is exactly her redistribution r \u03b8 \u2212 i .That is , r \u03b8 \u2212 i \u2265 0 for all \u03b8 \u2212 i hence for all \u03b8 ~ and all i is also necessary for individual rationality .We want to find VCG redistribution mechanisms that maximize the fraction of total VCG payment redistributed in the worst-case .This mechanism design problem is equivalent to the following functional optimization model :In this paper , we will analytically characterize one worst-case optimal VCG redistribution mechanism for heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand .1 We conclude this subsection with an example VCG redistribution mechanism in the simplest setting of single-item auctions .In a single-item auction , an agent 's type is a nonnegative real number representing her utility for winning the item .Without loss of generality , we assume that \u03b81 \u2265 \u03b82 \u2265 ... \u2265 \u03b8n \u2265 0 .In single-item auctions , the Bailey-Cavallo VCG redistribution mechanism 2 , 3 works as follows :second highest other type : Agent 1 and 2 each receives n1 \u03b83 .The other agents each receives n1\u03b82 .The above mechanism obviously maintains strategy-proofness and efficiency an agent 's redistribution does not depend on her own type .It also maintains individual rationality because all redistributions are nonnegative .The total redistribution equals 2n \u03b83 +the above mechanism maintains the non-deficit property .Finally , the total redistribution 2 n item auctions , this example mechanism 's worst-case redistribution fraction is n \u2212 2 nIn this subsection , we review existing results on worst-case optimal VCG redistribution mechanisms .Besides high-level discussions , we also choose to include a certain level of technical details , as they are needed for later sections .Worst-Case Optimal Redistribution in Multi-Unit Auctions with Unit Demand 7 , 12 : In multi-unit auctions with unit demand , the items for sale are identical .Each agent wants at most one copy of the item .Single-item auctions are special cases of multi-unit auctions with unit demand .Let m be the number of items .Throughout this paper , we only consider cases where m \u2264 n \u2212 2.2 Here , an agent 's type is a nonnegative real number representing her valuation for winning one copy of the item .It is without loss of generality to assume that \u03b81 \u2265 \u03b82 \u2265 ... \u2265 \u03b8n \u2265 0 .7 showed that for multi-unit auctions with unit demand , any VCG redistribution mechanism 's worst-case redistribution fraction is at most If we switch to a more general setting , then \u03b1 \u2217 is still an upper bound : if there exists a VCG redistribution mechanism whose worst-case redistribution fraction is strictly larger than \u03b1 \u2217 in a more general setting , then this mechanism , when applied to multi-unit auctions with unit demand , has a worst-case redistribution fraction that is strictly larger than \u03b1 \u2217 , which contradicts with the meaning of \u03b1 \u2217 .7 also characterized a VCG redistribution mechanism for multiunit auctions with unit demand , called the WCO mechanism .3 WCO 's worst-case redistribution fraction is exactly \u03b1 \u2217 .That is , it is worst-case optimal .WCO was obtained by optimizing within the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms .A linear VCG redistribution mechanism r takes the following form : Here , the ci are constants .We only consider the ci that correspond to feasible VCG redistribution mechanisms .\u03b8 \u2212 i j is the j-th highest type among \u03b8 \u2212 i. Linear mechanism r is characterized by the values of the ci .The optimal values the ci are as follows :for i = m + 1 , ... , n \u2212 1 , and c \u2217 i = 0 for i = 1 , 2 , ... , m .The characterization of WCO then follows :Nonincreasing Marginal Values 7 : Multi-unit auctions with non2 7 showed that for multi-unit auctions with unit demand , when m = n \u2212 1 , the worst-case redistribution fraction of any feasible VCG redistribution mechanism is at most 0 .Since the setting studied in this paper is more general heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand , we also have that the worst-case redistribution fraction is at most 0 when m = n \u2212 1 .Since heterogeneous-item auctions with x units are special cases of heterogeneous-item auctions with x + 1 units , we have that for our setting the worst-case redistribution fraction is at most 0 when m \u2265 n \u2212 1 .That is , not redistributing anything is worst-case optimal when m \u2265 n \u2212 1 .3WCO has also been independently derived in 12 , under a slightly different objective of maximizing worst-case efficiency ratio .Also , for 12 's objective , the optimal mechanism coincides with WCO only when the individual rationality constraint is enforced .increasing marginal values are more general than multi-unit auctions with unit demand .In this more general setting , the items are still identical , but an agent may demand more than one copy of the item .An agent 's valuation for winning the first copy of the item is called her initial/first marginal value .Similarly , an agent 's additional valuation for winning the i-th copy of the item is called her i-th marginal value .An agent 's type contains m nonnegative real numbers i-th marginal value for i = 1 , ... , m .In this setting , it is further assumed that the marginal values are nonincreasing .As discussed earlier , in this more general setting , any VCG redistribution mechanism 's worst-case redistribution fraction is still bounded above by \u03b1 * .7 generalized WCO to this setting , and proved that its worst-case redistribution fraction remains the same .Therefore , WCO after generalization is also worst-case optimal for multi-unit auctions with nonincreasing marginal values .The original definition of WCO does not directly generalize to multi-unit auctions with nonincreasing marginal values .When it comes to multi-unit auctions with nonincreasing marginal values , an agent 's type is no longer a single value , which means that there is no such thing as `` the j-th highest type among \u03b8_i '' .To address this , 7 replaced \u03b8_i j bym1R \u03b8_i , j \u2212 m \u2212 1 for j = m +1 , ... , n \u2212 1 .Basically , R \u03b8_i , j \u2212 m \u2212 1 is the generalization of \u03b8_i j : it is identical to \u03b8_i j in the unit demand setting , and it remains well-defined for multi-unit auctions with nonincreasing marginal values .We abuse notation by not differentiating the agents and their types .For example , \u03b8_i is equivalent to the set of agents other than i. Let S be a set of agents .R S , i is formally defined as follows this definition is included for completeness ; we will not use it anywhere :i \u2212 1 .Here , U S , j is the new set of agents , after removing the agent with the j-th highest initial marginal value in S from S .The general form of WCO is as follows :Worst-Case Optimal Redistribution in Heterogeneous-Item Auctions with Unit Demand 4 : In heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand , the items for sale are different .Each agent demands at most one item .Here , an agent 's type consists of m nonnegative real numbers her valuation for winning item i for i = 1 , ... , m .Heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand is the main focus of this paper .Since heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand is more general than multi-unit auctions with unit demand , \u03b1 * is still an upper bound on the worst-case redistribution fraction .4 proposed the HETERO mechanism , by generalizing WCO .The authors conjectured that HETERO is feasible and has a worst-case redistribution fraction that equals \u03b1 * .That is , the authors conjectured that HETERO is worst-case optimal in this setting .The main contribution of this paper is a proof of this conjecture .Redistribution in Combinatorial Auctions with Gross Substitutes 6 : The gross substitutes condition was first proposed in 9 .Like unit demand , the gross substitutes condition is a condition on an agent 's type does not depend on the mechanism under discussion .In words , an agent 's type satisfies the gross substitutes condition if her demand for an item does not decrease when the prices of the other items increase .Both multi-unit auctions with nonincreasing marginal values and heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand are special cases of combinatorial auctions with gross substitutes 5 , 9 .6 showed that for this setting , the worst-case redistribution fraction of the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism 2 , 3 is exactly n_m_1 n when n \u2265 m + 1 , and it is possible to construct mechanisms with even higher worst-case redistribution fractions .The authors did not find a worst-case optimal mechanism for this setting .At the end of this paper , we conjecture that HETERO is optimal for combinatorial auctions with gross substitutes .Finally , Naroditskiy et al. 13 proposed a numerical technique for designing worst-case optimal redistribution mechanisms .The proposed technique only works for single-parameter domains .It does not apply to our setting multi-parameter domain .We generalize WCO to heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand .We prove that the generalized mechanism , though represented differently , coincides with the HETERO mechanism proposed in 4 .That is , what we proposed is not a new mechanism , but a new representation of an existing mechanism .Based on our new representation of HETERO , we prove that HETERO is indeed feasible and worst-case optimal when applied to heterogeneousitem auctions with unit demand , thus confirming the conjecture raised in 4 .We conclude with a new conjecture that HETERO remains feasible and worst-case optimal in the even more general setting of combinatorial auctions with gross substitutes .", "title": "Worst-Case Optimal Redistribution of VCG Payments in Heterogeneous-Item Auctions with Unit Demand", "method": "We recall that WCO was obtained by optimizing within the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms .The original representation of HETERO was obtained using a similar approach 4 .The authors focused on the following family of mechanisms :Here , the \u03b2i are constants .t S , j is the expected total VCG payment when we remove j agents uniformly at random from S , and allocate all the items to the remaining agents .It is easy to see that all member mechanisms of the above family are well-defined for general combinatorial auctions .Not every member mechanism is feasible though .4 did not attempt optimizing over the family .Instead , the \u03b2i are chosen so that the corresponding mechanism coincides with WCO when it comes to multi-unit auctions with unit demand .It turns out that the choice is unique , and the corresponding mechanism is called HETERO .4 conjectured that HETERO is feasible and worst-case optimal for heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand .In this section , we propose another way to generalize WCO .We will show that the generalized WCO actually coincides with HETERO .That is , what we derive is a new representation of HETERO .This new representation will prove itself useful in later discussions .We recall that the characterization of WCO for multi-unit auctions with nonincreasing marginal values is based on a series of functions R S , i .These functions do not directly generalize to settings involving heterogeneous items , because , for i > 0 , R S , i is defined explicitly based on the agents ' initial marginal values .Fortunately , there is an easy way to rewrite R S , i , so that it becomes well-defined for settings involving heterogeneous items .Based on Equation 1 , WCO can be rewritten into the following form the only changes are that for i > 0 , R S , i 's definition no longer mentions `` initial marginal values '' : Definition 1 .Heterogeneous WCO new representation of HETERO :Heterogeneous WCO is well-defined for general combinatorial auctions , so we can directly apply it to heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand .Of course , we still have the burden to prove that it remains feasible and worst-case optimal .We will do so in the next section .Heterogeneous WCO is not a new mechanism .It turns out that it coincides with HETERO for general combinatorial auctions .That is , Definition 1 is a new representation of the existing mechanism HETERO .Similarly , R S , 2 = S 4 , R S , 3 = S 5 , ... , and finally R S , | S | \u2212 m \u2212 1 = R S , | S | \u2212 2 = S | S | lowest type from the agents in S .It is clear that redistribution monotonicity holds here .More generally , redistribution monotonicity holds for multi-unit auctions with nonincreasing marginal values : Claim 17 of 7 proved that R S , i is nonincreasing in i for multi-unit auctions with nonincreasing marginal values ; R S , i 's original definition as described in Subsection 1.2 makes it clear that the R S , i are nonnegative .The following proposition greatly simplifies our task :PROOF .We first prove that HETERO is feasible given redistribution monotonicity .According to Definition 1 , under HETERO , an agent 's redistribution does not depend on her own type .That is , HETERO is strategy-proof and efficient in all settings .We only need to prove that HETERO is individually rational and non-deficit given redistribution monotonicity .Individual rationality : As discussed in Subsection 1.1 , individual rationality is equivalent to redistributions being nonnegative .We recall that for multi-unit auctions with unit demand , under WCO , agent i 's redistribution equalsProof omitted since it is based on pure algebraic manipulation .In this section , we prove that HETERO , as represented in Definition 1 , is feasible and worst-case optimal for heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand .We first define the redistribution monotonicity condition : Definition 2 .An auction setting satisfies redistribution monotonicity if for any set of agents S , we have that R S , 0 \u2265 R S , 1 \u2265 ... \u2265 R S , | S | \u2212 m \u2212 1 \u2265 0 R was defined in Definition 1 .That is , R S , 0 = VCG S , and for i = 1 , ... , | S | \u2212 m \u2212 1 , R S , i equals !R S \u2212 a , i \u2212 1 \u2212 | S | \u2212 m \u2212 i R S , i \u2212 1 .For example , the setting of single-item auctions satisfies redistribution monotonicity .In a single-item auction , R S , 0 = V CG S = S 2 S i is the i-th highest type from the agents in S .This is equivalent to for all x0 \u2265 ... \u2265 xn \u2212 m \u2212 2 \u2265 0 ,Based on 2 and 4 substituting R \u03b8 \u2212 i , j for xj for all j , we have that 3 is nonnegative .Therefore , redistribution monotonicity implies individual rationality .Non-deficit and worst-case optimality : For multi-unit auctions with unit demand , under WCO , the total VCG payment is m\u03b8m +1 .The total redistribution isUnder HETERO , the total redistribution is The total VCG payment equals V CG ~ \u03b8 = R ~ \u03b8 , 0 .Redistribution monotonicity implies thatGiven 5 and 7 substituting R ~ \u03b8 , j for xj for all j , we have that 6 is between \u03b1 \u2217 times the total VCG payment and the total VCG payment .Therefore , redistribution monotonicity implies the non-deficit property and also worst-case optimality .We want to prove that for heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand , the following redistribution monotonicity condition holds .R S , 0 \u2265 R S , 1 \u2265 ... \u2265 R S , | S | \u2212 m \u2212 1 \u2265 0 By Proposition 3 , it suffices to prove that for all j , Rj S , 0 \u2265 Rj S , 1 \u2265 ... \u2265 Rj S , | S | \u2212 m \u2212 1 \u2265 0 .Without loss of generality , we will proveTo prove the above inequality , we need the following definitions and propositions .From now on to the end ofthis section , the setting by default is heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand , unless specified .We use E T , S to denote the efficient total valuation when we allocate all the items in T to the agents in S.In the remaining of this section , we prove that heterogeneousitem auctions with unit demand satisfies redistribution monotonicity , which would then imply that HETERO is feasible and worstcase optimal for heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand .We define Rj S , i by modifying the definition of R S , i in Definition 1 .14 showed that the proposition is true when gross substitutes condition holds .Heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand satisfies gross substitutes .We use 1 \u2295 1 , ... , m to denote the item set that contains not only item 1 to m , but also an additional duplicate of item 1 .PROPOSITION 5 .Let S be any set of agents .Let a be the agent who wins item 1 when we allocate the items 1 , ... , m to the agents in S .We have that E 1 \u2295 1 , ... , m , S = E 1 , a + E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 a .That is , after we add an additional duplicate of item 1 to the auction , there exists an efficient allocation under which agent a still wins item 1 .The above proposition was proved in 11 .PROOF .We prove by induction .When i = 0 , by definition , for any S ,PROOF .Let w1 be the winner of item 1 when we allocate the items 1 , ... , m to the agents in S using VCG .V CG1 S = E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 E 2 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 .a could be either w1 or some other agent .We discuss case by case .Case a = w1 : Let w \u2032 1 be the new winner of item 1 when we allocate the items 1 , ... , m to the agents in S \u2212 w1 using VCG .V CG1 S \u2212 w1 = E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 w \u2032 1 \u2212 E 2 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 w \u2032 1 .We need to prove that E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 E 2 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2265 E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 w \u2032 1 \u2212 E 2 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 w \u2032 1 .We construct a new agent x. Let x 's valuation for item 1 be extremely high so that she wins item 1 .The above inequality can be rewritten as E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 E 2 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 E 1 , x \u2265 E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 w \u2032 1 \u2212 E 2 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 w \u2032 1 \u2212 E 1 , x .Thisis , E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 + x > E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 w \u2032 1 \u2212 E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 w \u2032 1 + x .We rearrange the terms , and get E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 +Case a = 6 w1 : Let w \u2032 1 be the new winner of item 1 when we allocate all the items 1 , ... , m to the agents in S \u2212 a using VCG .PROPOSITION 7 .Winners still win after we remove some other agents 4 , 6 :4 For any set of agents S and any set of items T , we use W to denote the set of winners when we allocate the items in T to the agents in S using VCG .After we remove some agents in S , those in W that have not been removed remain to be winners , provided that a consistent tie-breaking rule exists .It should be noted that there may not exist a consistent tie-breaking rule that satisfies the above proposition .Fortunately , we are able to prove that tie-breaking is irrelevant for the goal of proving redistribution monotonicity .We say that a type profile is tie-free if it satisfies the following : Let T1 = 1 \u00ae 1 , ... , m .Let T2 = 1 , ... , m .Basically , T1 and T2 are the only item sets that we will ever mention .A type profile is tie-free if for any set of agents S , when we allocate the items in T1 or T2 to S , the set of VCG winners is unique .If we only consider tie-free type profiles , then we do not need to be bothered by tie-breaking .We notice that the set of tie-free type profiles is a dense subset of the set of all type profiles any type profile can be perturbed infinitesimally to become a tie-free type profile .Our ultimate goal is to prove that for any set of agents S , R S , 0 > R S , 1 > ... > R S , | S | \u2212 m \u2212 1 > 0 We notice that the R S , j are continuous in the agents ' types .Therefore , it suffices to prove the above inequality for tie-free type profiles only .From now on , we simply assume that the set of VCG winners is always unique .Definition 3 .For any set of agents S with | S | > m +1 , let D S be the set of m + 1 winners when we allocate 1 \u00ae 1 , ... , m to the agents in S. D S is called the determination set of S.The above proposition says that for the purpose of calculating item 1 's VCG price , only those agents in D S are relevant .4The proposition was originally introduced in 4 .A more rigorous proof of a more general claim was also given in 6 .Let w1 be the winner of item 1 when we allocate 1 , ... , m to the agents in S. V CG1 S = E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 \u2212 E 2 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 = E 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 w1 + E 1 , w1 \u2212 E 1 , ... , m , S = E 1 \u00ae 1 , ... , m , S \u2212 E 1 , ... , m , S the last step is due to Proposition 5 .The first term only depends on those in D S .The second term also only depends on those in D S for the following reason : Let S \u2032 be the set of VCG winners when we allocate 1 , ... , m to the agents in S .The second term only depends on those in S \u2032 .We introduce an agent x whose valuation for item 1 is extremely high so that she wins item 1 .When we allocate 1 \u00ae 1 , ... , m to the agents in S + x , the set of VCG winners are then x + S \u2032 .D S are the new set of VCG winners after we remove x. By Proposition 7 , those in S \u2032 must still remain in D S .Overall , V CG1 S only depends on those agents in D S .Similarly , V CG1 S \u2212 a only depends on those agents in D S \u2212 a .For a \u2208 S \u2212 D S , D S = D S \u2212 a .Therefore , we must have VCG1 S = VCG1 S \u2212 a .Definition 4 .Let S be any set of agents .Let k be any integer from 1 to | S | .Let a1 \u227a a2 \u227a ... \u227a ak be a sequence of k distinct agents in S .We say these k agents form a winner sequence with respect to S ifLet S \u2032 be a subset of S of size k .We say that S \u2032 forms a winner sequence with respect to S if there exists an ordering of the agents in S \u2032 that forms a winner sequence with respect to S .When S \u2032 forms a winner sequence with respect to S , we call S \u2032 a size | S \u2032 | winner sequence set with respect to S. Let H S \u2032 , S = 1 if S \u2032 forms a winner sequence with respect to S , and let H S \u2032 , S = 0 otherwise .For presentation purpose , we say that the empty set forms a winner sequence of size 0 with respect to any set S .That is , H \u2205 , S = 1 .Now we are ready to prove that heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand satisfies redistribution monotonicity .We recall that it suffices to prove that for any set of agents S ,Now let us analyze the expression Pa \u2208 S R1 S \u2212 a , k .By induction assumption , it can be rewritten asThe following lemmas are needed for the proof of the above proposition .All these lemmas are implications of `` winners still win after we remove some other agents '' .The proofs are omitted due to space constraints .Now we are ready to prove the proposition .PROOF .We prove by induction .Initial step : We have R1 S , 0 = VCG1 S .When k = 0 ,We need to prove that the results hold for k + 1 .That is , for any S | S | \u2265 k + m + 2 , | S | m + k By induction assumption , the above expression is the sum of ~ terms .Each term corresponds to one choice of a among S and one choice of S \u2032 among S \u2212 a .We divide these | S | m + kterms into two groups : Group A , terms with a \u2208 / D S \u2212 S \u2032 : By Lemma 2 , S \u2032 must also form a winner sequence with respect to S .That is , there are at most m + k ~ choices of S \u2032 .For each choice of S \u2032 , there are at k most | S \u2212 S \u2032 \u2212 D S \u2212 S \u2032 | = | S | \u2212 k \u2212 m \u2212 1 choices of a. Overall , there are at most m + k ~ | S | \u2212 k \u2212 m \u2212 1 terms in Group k A. On the other hand , for any S \u2032 that forms a winner sequence with respect to S , S \u2032 must also form a winner sequence with respect to S \u2212 a by Lemma 1 .For any a \u2208 / D S \u2212 S \u2032 , there must be a term in Group A that is characterized by a and S \u2032 .That is , there are at least m + k ~ | S | \u2212 k \u2212 m \u2212 1 terms in Group A. Hence , there are exactly m + ka \u2208 / D S \u2212 S \u2032 , we have that V CG1 S \u2212 a \u2212 S \u2032 = V CG1 S \u2212 S \u2032 by Proposition 8 .Therefore , the sum of all the terms in Group A equalsk + 1 winner sequence sets with respect to S .According to Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 , every term in Group B must corresponds to an element in X , and every element in X must correspond to exactly k + 1 terms in Group B e.g. , a size k + 1 winner sequence set Y = x1 , ... , xk +1 corresponds to the following k + 1 terms : a = xi and S \u2032 = Y \u2212 xi for all i .Therefore , the total number of elements in X must be m + k +1 ~ .m The sum of the terms in Group B equalsProposition 9 implies that function R1 is always nonnegative .We still need to prove that R1 S , 0 > R1 S , 1 > ... > R1 S , ISI m 1 .Due to space constraint , we only present an outline of the proof of R1 S , 3 > R1 S , 4 , which highlights the main idea behind the full proof .a , 3 ISI m 4 R1 S , 3 .To prove that R1 S , 4 < R1 S , 3 , it suffices to prove that R1 S , 3 > R1 S a , 3 for any a E S. Let a be an arbitrary agent in S .According to Proposition 9 , we need to provesition 9 .Every term is characterized by a size-3 winner sequence set S \u2032 ..For every term on the right-hand side , we map it to a corresponding term on the left-hand side .The corresponding term on the left-hand side is larger or the same ..We prove that the mapping is injective .That is , different terms on the right-hand side are mapped to different terms on the left-hand side ..Therefore , the left-hand side must be greater than or equal to the right-hand side .", "conclusions": "We conclude our paper with the following conjecture : CONJECTURE 1 .Gross substitutes implies redistribution monotonicity .That is , HETERO remainsfeasible and worst-case optimal in combinatorial auctions with gross substitutes .The idea is that both multi-unit auctions with nonincreasing marginal values and heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand satisfy redistribution monotonicity .A natural conjecture is that the `` most restrictive joint '' of these two settings also satisfies redistribution monotonicity .There are many well-studied auction settings that contain both multi-unit auctions with nonincreasing marginal values and heterogeneous-item auctions with unit demand a list of which can be found in 10 .Among these well-studied settings , combinatorial auctions with gross substitutes is the most restrictive .To prove the conjecture , we need to prove that gross substitutes implies that for any set of agents S , R S , 0 > R S , 1 > ... > R S , ISI m 1 > 0 .So far , we have only proved R S , 0 > R S , 1 > 0 .", "author_keywords_stem": ["mechan design", "vickrei-clark-grove mechan", "payment redistribut"]}
