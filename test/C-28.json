biology , given the number and diversity of the sequences and the frequency on which it is needed to be solved daily .SW 14 is an exact algorithm that finds the best local alignment between two sequences of size n in quadratic time and space .In genome projects , the size of the sequences to be compared is constantly increasing , thus an O n2 solution is expensive .For this reason , heuristics like BLAST 3 were proposed to reduce execution time .The popularity of the Internet made possible the interconnection of millions of powerful machines in a global scale .* Produces the permission block , and copyright information .For use with SIG-ALTERNATE .CLS .Supported by ACM .This led to the idea of grid computing , which involves cooperative and secure sharing of non-dedicated and heterogeneous resources that are geographically distributed 5 .Resource scheduling is one of the most important components of a grid system .The choice of the best resources for a particular application is called task allocation , which is an NP-Complete problem .Grid applications usually do not have high communication rates and many of them follow the master/slave model 13 .In order to schedule master/slave applications many task allocation policies were proposed such as Self Scheduling 15 and FAC2 8 .The choice of the best allocation policy depends on the application access pattern and on the environment in which it runs 13 .In this paper , we propose PackageBLAST , an adaptive multi-policy grid service to run BLAST searches in grids composed by segmented genetic databases .PackageBLAST executes on Globus 3 4 and , by now , provides five allocation policies .Also , we propose an adaptive mechanism to assign weights to the grid nodes , taking into account their current workload .As far as we know , this is the first grid service that runs BLAST with multiple task policies with a segmented database in a heterogeneous non-dedicated platform .This paper is organized as follows .Section 2 presents the sequence comparison problem and the BLAST algorithm .Section 3 describes allocation policies for grids .Section 4 discusses related work .Section 5 presents the design of PackageBLAST .Experimental results are discussed in section 6 .Section 7 concludes the paper .", "title": "PackageBLAST : An Adaptive Multi-Policy Grid Service for Biological Sequence Comparison *", "method": "To compare two sequences , we must find the best alignment , which is to place one sequence above the other making clear the correspondence between similar characters 7 .Given an alignment between two sequences , a score is usually associated for it as follows figure 1 .For each column , we associate , for instance , +1 if the two characters are identical , -1 if the characters are different and -2 if one of them is a space .The score is the sum of all the values and the maximal score is the similarity between the sequences .To compute exact local sequence alignments , 14 proposed an algorithm SW , based on dynamic programming , with quadratic time and space complexity .Usually , one given biological sequence is compared against thousands or even millions of sequences that compose genetic data banks .By now , there are millions of entries composed of billions of nucleotides at GenBank , which is one of the most important public gene repositories .Due to thecurrent growth rate , these databases will soon achieve terabytes .In this scenario , the use of exact methods such as SW is prohibitive .For this reason , faster heuristic methods are proposed which do not guarantee that the best alignment will be produced .Usually , these heuristic methods are evaluated using the concepts of sensitivity and sensibility .Sensitivity is the rate at which the method fails to identify similar sequences whereas sensibility is the rate at which the method identifies sequences that are not similar 7 .BLAST 1 is the most widely used heuristic method for sequence comparison .BLAST Basic Local Alignment Tool 1 is a set of programs used to search DNA and protein databases for similarities between sequences .It is designed to obtain high performance with low impact in terms of sensibility .BLAST provides programs to compare many combinations of query and database sequence types table 1 .The first version of BLAST searched for local similarities without taking spaces gaps into account .In 1996-1997 , two gapped versions of BLAST emerged : NCBI-BLAST 3 and WU-BLAST 6 .Basically , the algorithm proceeds in three steps : seeding , extension and evaluation .In the seeding step , a query sequence is split in portions called words of size W .These words are matched to database sequences and used as alignment seeds if their scores are higher than a threshold T .In the extension step , alignments are generated from seeds .A parameter X maintains the recent alignment history and controls this step .Once seeds are extended , the last step begins .The alignments are evaluated to determine if they are statistically significant .The significant ones are termed HSPs High-scoring Segment Pairs .A new parameter , S , is used to sort alignments .The combination of parameters W , T , X and S is used to determine the sensitivity and speed of BLAST searches .Grid Computing was initially developed to enable resource sharing between scientific institutions who needed to share data , software and computational power .The Globus Toolkit 4 emerged as an open source project and quickly became a de facto standard for grid computing infrastructure .Globus implements a set of protocols , APIs and services used by hundreds of grid applications all over the world .In 2002 , the Open Grid Services Architecture OGSA was introduced by the Global Grid Forum GGF to expand standardization .OGSA provided a new architecture for grid applications based on web services in order to achieve interoperability using industry standards .Many OGSA architecture implementations were developed , including one for Globus .The work carried out in this paper is deployed on a grid based on Globus GT3 .Usually , grid applications are modelled as master/slave , where one problem is divided in many independent work units tasks of smaller size that can be distributed to slave nodes for parallel processing .A very important problem to be solved in this context is task allocation .The task allocation problem consists of assigning tasks to processors in order to maximize system performance 13 .In this problem , it is assumed that no precedence relations exist among the tasks .Given a master/slave application composed by a master m and S slaves , the allocation function allocate m , si , N , S determines how many tasks out of N must be assigned to a slave si equation 1 , where A N , S represents an allocation policy .WeightFactor m , si , S was defined by 13 equation 2 and provides weights for each slave si , based on its statically known processing rate WorkerRate .The following subsections present some work allocation policies , which are instances A N , S of equation 1 .The Fixed 13 strategy distributes all work units uniformly to slaves nodes .This strategy is appropriate for homogeneous systems with dedicated resources equation 3 .Self Scheduling SS 15 distributes a single work unit to every slave node equation 4 .In SS , the maximum imbalance is limited by the processing time of a work unit in the slowest node .Nevertheless , SS usually demands a lot of communication , since each work unit retrieval requires one interaction with the master .Trapezoidal Self-Scheduling TSS 16 allocates work units in groups with a linearly decreasing size .This strategy uses two variables , steps and \u03b4 , that represent the total number of allocation steps and the block reduction factor , respectively equations 5 and 6 .TSS calculates the length of the sth block using the difference between the length of the first block and total reduction from the last s \u2212 1 blocks equation 7 .Guided Self-Scheduling GSS 11 allocates work units in groups whose length decrease exponentially .Its goal is to create a tradeoff between the number of the work units processed and the imbalance in finishing times equation 8 .FAC2 allocates work units in cycles consisting of S allocation sequences .Equation 9 shows the function that defines the cycle number of an iteration s .In FAC2 , half of the remaining work units are allocated in each round equation 10 .We propose an adaptive task allocation framework which is a grid service to perform BLAST searches against sequence database segments .The framework , called PackageBLAST , provides an infrastructure to choose or incorporate allocation strategies in a master/slave application .We also propose a strategy to compute grid nodes execution weight which distributes work units database segments to grid nodes according to their current computational power .Segmentation consists in the division of a database archive in many portions of smaller size , called segments , that can be processed independently .It enables grid nodes to search smaller parts of a sequence database , reducing the number of disk accesses and hence improving BLAST performance .Also , a single query sequence can be compared against all segments in parallel .Just as in mpiBLAST section 4 , we decided to use database segmentation in PackageBLAST with an NCBI tool called formatdb , which was modified to generate more database segments of smaller size .We opted to replicate the segmented database in every slave grid node to improve data accesses times and to provide a potential for fault tolerance .Figure 2 illustrates this .As 13 , we think that no allocation policy will produce the best results for every situation .Thus , we propose the use of a framework where many allocation policies can be incorporated .By now , our framework contains five allocation policies : Fixed , SS , GSS , TSS , FAC2 , all described in section 3 .So , the user can choose or even create the allocation policy which is the most appropriate to his/her environment and his/her BLAST parameters .Besides that , we propose PSS Package Weighted Adaptive Self-Scheduling , a new strategy that adapts the chosen allocation policy to a grid with local workload .Considering the heterogeneity and dynamic characteristics of the grid , PSS is able to modify the length of the work units during execution , based on average processing time of each node .The expression used for work unit allocation is shown in equation 11 , where A N , P is the allocation policy for a system with N workload units and P nodes and \u03a6 m , pi , P is the weight calculated by PSS .A N , P can be a pre-defined allocation policy or a user-defined one .allocate m , pi , N , P = A N , P \u2217 4 m , pi , P 11 To distribute database segments to nodes , the master analyzes periodic slave notifications .The expression used is \u03a6 m , pi , P equation 12 , defined as the weighted mean from the last \u03a9 notifications sent by each pi slave node .\u0393 m , pi , \u03a9 equation 13 specifies the average computing time of a segment in a node pi , considering the last \u03a9 notifications of TE m , pi , \u03c4 , which is the average computation time of \u03c4 work units database segments assigned by the master m to a slave pi .At the moment of computation of \u0393 , if there is not enough notifications of TE , the calculation is done with total k notifications already received .PackageBLAST was designed as a grid service over Globus 3 , based on Web Services and Java .Figure 3 presents the PackageBLAST architecture .The module Allocation Strategies contains implementations for the pre-defined allocation policies Fixed , SS , GSS , TSS and FAC2 and also makes possible the creation of new allocation strategies .The module Generate Work Units is the core of the PSS mechanism .It calculates the weight of each slave node and decides how many work units will be assigned to a particular slave node , according to the chosen allocation policy .Distribute Work Units is the module responsible for the communication between the master and slaves nodes .It distributes the work units generated by the previous module and collects the notifications .Finally , the module Generate Reports obtains the intermediary outputs sent by the slave nodes through file transfer and merges them into a single BLAST output report .In general , the following execution flow is executed .The user specifies the sequence to be compared and chooses the allocation strategy .The master node starts execution and waits for slave connections .To start processing , a minimum number of slaves must register into the master node , by calling a master grid service .After receiving connections from the slaves , the master notifies them about their initial segments to compare .The slave processes \u03c4 database segments and notifies the master , which uses the last \u03a9 notifications to compute the next allocation block size based on the selected allocation strategy and the weight provided by PSS .Then , the master sends a XML message to the slave informing its new segments to process .This flow continues until all segments are processed .", "evaluation": "PackageBLAST was evaluated in a 16-node grid testbed , composed by two laboratories , interconnected by a localarea network .Eleven desktops P01-11 and a notebook NB were used in LABPOS and four desktops L01-04 were used in LAICO table 2 .All grid nodes used Linux with Globus 3.2.1 , NCBI BLAST 2.2.10 and Java VM 1.4.2 .To investigate the performance gains of PackageBLAST , we executed BLASTX in 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 grid nodes .Each BLAST search compared a 10KBP real DNA sequence against the 1.2 GB nr genetic database segmented in 167 parts of 5MB each .Fixed , SS , TSS , GSS and FAC2 allocation strategies were employed in the tests .Execution times for all allocation strategies are presented in table 3 .Table 4 presents execution times in a single machine and absolute speedups for 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 nodes , considering the best execution time for a given number of nodes .To calculate the absolute speedups , the BLAST sequential version was executed with the nr unsegmented database .PackageBLAST achieved very good speedups .Considering the worst L04 , average P01 and best NB node in the grid , the speedups obtained were superlinear , close to linear and sublinear , respectively .In table 3 , it can also be noticed that there is no allocation strategy that always reaches the best execution time .This variation justifies the allocation framework provided .To evaluate PSS , we executed PackageBLAST with 16 grid nodes , introducing local workload in nodes L01 , L02 , P01 and P02 .The load was started simultaneously 30 seconds after the beginning of BLAST and consisted of the reports work units to slavesexecution of formatdb on the nr database .Three scenarios were simulated table 5 : 1 with PSS strategy , but without workload ; 2 with PSS strategy and workload PSS 2x , to use grid environment knowledge obtained in the preceeding iteration ; and 3 Execution without PSS and with workload .As expected , the allocation strategies that assign a large amount of work to the nodes fixed and GSS obtained great benefit from using PSS .This is due to the fact that a slow node can easily become a bottleneck in these strategies .TSS also obtained a reduction of 5.56 % in its execution time .PSS uses two parameters : \u03c4 and \u03a9 section 5.2 .We varied these parameters in order to evaluate the PSS behavior in two scenarios .In both cases , we used a four-node NB , L01 , P01 , L04 grid .In the first experiment , a local workload formatdb was introduced when the last task of the first TSS allocation starts and was stopped immediately after the processing of one segment .The goal was to evaluate the impact of short-lived local tasks in PSS .In the second case , local workload was introduced at the same time of the previous case , but continued until the end .The goal was to evaluate long-lived local tasks .Figure 4 presents the gains .In scenario 1 , when a very recent history is considered \u03c4 = 1 and \u03a9 = 1 , PSS tries to adapt to a situation that will shortly disappear .For \u03c4 = 5 and \u03a9 = 4 , PSS takes longer to notice modification and short-lived tasks have low impact .On the other hand , in scenario 2 , \u03c4 = 1 , \u03a9 = 1 presents better results than \u03c4 = 5 , \u03a9 = 4 , because it changes weights faster .", "author_keywords_stem": ["bioinformat", "grid comput", "task
