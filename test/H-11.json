data but labels are expensive .The challenge is thus to determine which unlabeled samples would be the most informative i.e. , improve the classifier the most if they were labeled and used as training samples .This problem is typically called active learning 4 .Here the task is to minimize an overall cost , which depends both on the classifier accuracy and the cost of data collection .Many real world applications can be casted into active learning framework .Particularly , we consider the problem of relevance feedback driven Content-Based Image Retrieval CBIR 13 .Content-Based Image Retrieval has attracted substantial interests in the last decade 13 .It is motivated by the fast growth of digital image databases which , in turn , require efficient search schemes .Rather than describe an image using text , in these systems an image query is described using one or more example images .The low level visual features color , texture , shape , etc. are automatically extracted to represent the images .However , the low level features may not accurately characterize the high level semantic concepts .To narrow down the semantic gap , relevance feedback is introduced into CBIR 12 .In many of the current relevance feedback driven CBIR systems , the user is required to provide his/her relevance judgments on the top images returned by the system .The labeled images are then used to train a classifier to separate images that match the query concept from those that do not .However , in general the top returned images may not be the most informative ones .In the worst case , all the top images labeled by the user may be positive and thus the standard classification techniques can not be applied due to the lack of negative examples .Unlike the standard classification problems where the labeled samples are pregiven , in relevance feedback image retrieval the system can actively select the images to label .Thus active learning can be naturally introduced into image retrieval .Despite many existing active learning techniques , Support Vector Machine SVM active learning 14 and regression based active learning 1 have received the most interests .Based on the observation that the closer to the SVM boundary an image is , the less reliable its classification is , SVM active learning selects those unlabeled images closest to the boundary to solicit user feedback so as to achieve maximal refinement on the hyperplane between the two classes .The major disadvantage of SVM active learning is that the estimated boundary may not be accurate enough .Moreover , it may not be applied at the beginning of the retrieval when there is no labeled images .Some other SVM based active learning algorithms can be found in 7 , 9 .In statistics , the problem of selecting samples to label is typically referred to as experimental design .The sample x is referred to as experiment , and its label y is referred to as measurement .The study of optimal experimental design OED 1 is concerned with the design of experiments that are expected to minimize variances of a parameterized model .The intent of optimal experimental design is usually to maximize confidence in a given model , minimize parameter variances for system identification , or minimize the model 's output variance .Classical experimental design approaches include A-Optimal Design , D-Optimal Design , and E-Optimal Design .All of these approaches are based on a least squares regression model .Comparing to SVM based active learning algorithms , experimental design approaches are much more efficient in computation .However , this kind of approaches takes only measured or , labeled data into account in their objective function , while the unmeasured or , unlabeled data is ignored .Benefit from recent progresses on optimal experimental design and semi-supervised learning , in this paper we propose a novel active learning algorithm for image retrieval , called Laplacian Optimal Design LOD .Unlike traditional experimental design methods whose loss functions are only defined on the measured points , the loss function of our proposed LOD algorithm is defined on both measured and unmeasured points .Specifically , we introduce a locality preserving regularizer into the standard least-square-error based loss function .The new loss function aims to find a classifier which is locally as smooth as possible .In other words , if two points are sufficiently close to each other in the input space , then they are expected to share the same label .Once the loss function is defined , we can select the most informative data points which are presented to the user for labeling .It would be important to note that the most informative images may not be the top returned images .The rest of the paper is organized as follows .In Section 2 , we provide a brief description of the related work .Our proposed Laplacian Optimal Design algorithm is introduced in Section 3 .In Section 4 , we compare our algorithm with the state-or-the-art algorithms and present the experimental results on image retrieval .Finally , we provide some concluding remarks and suggestions for future work in Section 5 .", "title": "Laplacian Optimal Design for Imag e Retrieval", "method": "Since the covariance matrix Hsse used in traditional approaches is only dependent on the measured samples , i.e. zi 's , these approaches fail to evaluate the expected errors on the unmeasured samples .In this Section , we introduce a novel active learning algorithm called Laplacian Optimal Design LOD which makes efficient use of both measured labeled and unmeasured unlabeled samples .In many machine learning problems , it is natural to assume that if two points xi , xj are sufficiently close to each other , then their measurements f xi , f xj are close aswell .Let S be a similarity matrix .Thus , a new loss function which respects the geometrical structure of the data space can be defined as follows : where yi is the measurement or , label of zi .Note that , the loss function 3 is essentially the same as the one used in Laplacian Regularized Regression LRR , 2 .However , LRR is a passive learning algorithm where the training data is given .In this paper , we are focused on how to select the most informative data for training .The loss function with our choice of symmetric weights Sij Sij = Sji incurs a heavy penalty if neighboring points xi and xj are mapped far apart .Therefore , minimizing J0 w is an attempt to ensure that if xi and xj are close then f xi and f xj are close as well .There are many choices of the similarity matrix S .A simple definition is as follows :Let D be a diagonal matrix , Dii = ~ j Sij , and L = D \u2212 S .The matrix L is called graph Laplacian in spectral graph theory 3 .Let y = y1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yk T and X = x1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xm .Following some simple algebraic steps , we see that :where I is an identity matrix and \u039b = \u03bb1XLXT + \u03bb2I .Clearly , H is of full rank .Requiring that the gradient of J w with respect to w vanish gives the optimal estimate \u02c6w :The following proposition states the bias and variance properties of the estimator for the coefficient vector w.For any x , let y\u02c6 = \u02c6wT x be its predicted observation .The expected squared prediction error is E y \u2212 \u02c6y 2In some cases , the matrix ZZT + \u03bbXLXT is singular e.g. if m < d .Thus , there is no stable solution to the optimization problem Eq .3 .A common way to deal with this ill-posed problem is to introduce a Tikhonov regularizer into our loss function : J w Clearly the expected square prediction error depends on the explanatory variable x , therefore average expected square predictive error over the complete data set A isOur Laplacian optimality criterion is thus formulated by minimizing the trace of XT H \u2212 1X .where z1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , zk are selected from x1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xm .Canonical experimental design approaches e.g. A-Optimal Design , D-Optimal Design , and E-Optimal only consider linear functions .They fail to discover the intrinsic geometry in the data when the data space is highly nonlinear .In this section , we describe how to perform Laplacian Experimental Design in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space RKHS which gives rise to Kernel Laplacian Experimental Design KLOD .For given data points x1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xm \u2208 X with a positive definite mercer kernel K : X \u00d7 X \u2192 R , there exists a unique RKHS HK of real valued functions on X. Let Kt s be the function of s obtained by fixing t and letting Kt s .= K s , t .HK consists of all finite linear combinations of the form ~ li = 1 \u03b1iKti with ti \u2208 X and limits of such functions as the ti become dense in X .We have ~ Ks , Kt ~ HK = K s , t .Consider the optimization problem 5 in RKHS .Thus , we seek a function f \u2208 HK such that the following objective function is minimized :We have the following proposition .PROOF .Let H \u22a5 be the orthogonal complement of H , i.e. HK = H \u2295 H \u22a5 .Thus , for any function f \u2208 HK , it has orthogonal decomposition as follows :Notice that Kxi \u2208 H while fH \u22a5 \u2208 H \u22a5 .This implies that ~ fH \u22a5 , Kxi ~ HK = 0 .Therefore , f xi = ~ fH , Kxi ~ HK = fH xi This completes the proof .Proposition 4.1 tells us the minimizer of problem 12 admits a representation f \u2217 = ~ mi = 1 \u03b1iK \u00b7 , xi .Please see 2 for the details .Let \u03c6 : Rd \u2192 H be a feature map from the input space Rd to H , and K xi , xj = < \u03c6 xi , \u03c6 xj > .Let X denote the data matrix in RKHS , X = \u03c6 x1 , \u03c6 x2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c6 xm .Similarly , we define Z = \u03c6 z1 , \u03c6 z2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c6 zk .Thus , the optimization problem in RKHS can be written as follows :Since the mapping function \u03c6 is generally unknown , there is no direct way to solve problem 13 .In the following , we apply kernel tricks to solve this optimization problem .Let X \u2212 1 be the Moore-Penrose inverse also known as pseudo inverse of X. Thus , we have :where KXX is a m \u00d7 m matrix KXX , ij = K xi , xj , KXZ is a m \u00d7 k matrix KXZ , ij = K xi , zj , and KZX is a k \u00d7 m matrix KZX , ij = K zi , xj .Thus , the Kernel Laplacian Optimal Design can be defined as follows :In this subsection , we discuss how to solve the optimization problems 11 and 14 .Particularly , if we select a linear kernel for KLOD , then it reduces to LOD .Therefore , we will focus on problem 14 in the following .It can be shown that the optimization problem 14 is NP-hard .In this subsection , we develop a simple sequential greedy approach to solve 14 .Suppose n points have been selected , denoted by a matrix Zn = z1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , zn .The n + 1 th point zn +1 can be selected by solving the following optimization problem :If the kernel function is chosen as inner product K x , y = x , y , then WK is a linear functional space and the algorithm reduces to LOD .In this section , we describe how to apply Laplacian Optimal Design to CBIR .We begin with a brief description of image representation using low level visual features .Low-level image representation is a crucial problem in CBIR .General visual features includes color , texture , shape , etc. .Color and texture features are the most extensively used visual features in CBIR .Compared with color and texture features , shape features are usually described after images have been segmented into regions or objects .Since robust and accurate image segmentation is difficult to achieve , the use of shape features for image retrieval has been limited to special applications where objects or regions are readily available .In this work , We combine 64-dimensional color histogram and 64-dimensional Color Texture Moment CTM , 15 to represent the images .The color histogram is calculated using 4 x 4 x 4 bins in HSV space .The Color Texture Moment is proposed by Yu et al. 15 , which integrates the color and texture characteristics of the image in a compact form .CTM adopts local Fourier transform as a texture representation scheme and derives eight characteristic maps to describe different aspects of co-occurrence relations of image pixels in each channel of the SVcosH , SVsinH , V color space .Then CTM calculates the first and second moment of these maps as a representation of the natural color image pixel distribution .Please see 15 for details .Relevance feedback is one of the most important techniques to narrow down the gap between low level visual features and high level semantic concepts 12 .Traditionally , the user 's relevance feedbacks are used to update the query vector or adjust the weighting of different dimensions .This process can be viewed as an on-line learning process in which the image retrieval system acts as a learner and the user acts as a teacher .They typical retrieval process is outlined as follows :Our Laplacian Optimal Design algorithm is applied in the second step for selecting the most informative images .Once we get the labels for the images selected by LOD , we apply Laplacian Regularized Regression LRR , 2 to solve the optimization problem 3 and build the classifier .The classifier is then used to re-rank the images in database .Note that , in order to reduce the computational complexity , we do not use all the unlabeled images in the database but only those within top 500 returns of previous iteration .", "evaluation": "In this section , we evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm on a large image database .To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LOD algorithm , we compare it with Laplacian Regularized Regression LRR , 2 , Support Vector Machine SVM , Support Vector Machine Active Learning SVMactive 14 , and A-Optimal Design AOD .Both SVMactive , AOD , and LOD are active learning algorithms , while LRR and SVM are standard classification algorithms .SVM only makes use of the labeled images , while LRR is a semi-supervised learning algorithm which makes use of both labeled and unlabeled images .For SVMactive , AOD , and LOD , 10 training images are selected by the algorithms themselves at each iteration .While for LRR and SVM , we use the top 10 images as training data .It would be important to note that SVMactive is based on the ordinary SVM , LOD is based on LRR , and AOD is based on the ordinary regression .The parameters \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 in our LOD algorithm are empirically set to be 0.001 and 0.00001 .For both LRR and LOD algorithms , we use the same graph structure see Eq .4 and set the value of p number of nearest neighbors to be 5 .We begin with a simple synthetic example to give some intuition about how LOD works .A simple synthetic example is given in Figure 1 .The data set contains two circles .Eight points are selected by AOD and LOD .As can be seen , all the points selected by AOD are from the big circle , while LOD selects four points from the big circle and four from the small circle .The numbers beside the selected points denote their orders to be selected .Clearly , the points selected by our LOD algorithm can better represent the original data set .We did not compare our algorithm with SVMactive because SVMactive can not be applied in this case due to the lack of the labeled points .The image database we used consists of 7,900 images of 79 semantic categories , from COREL data set .It is a large and heterogeneous image set .Each image is represented as a 128-dimensional vector as described in Section 5.1 .Figure 2 shows some sample images .To exhibit the advantages of using our algorithm , we need a reliable way of evaluating the retrieval performance and the comparisons with other algorithms .We list different aspects of the experimental design below .We use precision-scope curve and precision rate 10 to evaluate the effectiveness of the image retrieval algorithms .The scope is specified by the number N of top-ranked images presented to the user .The precision is the ratio of the number of relevant images presented to the user to thescope N .The precision-scope curve describes the precision with various scopes and thus gives an overall performance evaluation of the algorithms .On the other hand , the precision rate emphasizes the precision at a particular value of scope .In general , it is appropriate to present 20 images on a screen .Putting more images on a screen may affect the quality of the presented images .Therefore , the precision at top 20 N = 20 is especially important .In real world image retrieval systems , the query image is usually not in the image database .To simulate such environment , we use five-fold cross validation to evaluate the algorithms .More precisely , we divide the whole image database into five subsets with equal size .Thus , there are 20 images per category in each subset .At each run of cross validation , one subset is selected as the query set , and the other four subsets are used as the database for retrieval .The precisionscope curve and precision rate are computed by averaging the results from the five-fold cross validation .We designed an automatic feedback scheme to model the retrieval process .For each submitted query , our system retrieves and ranks the images in the database .10 images were selected from the database for user labeling and the label information is used by the system for re-ranking .Note that , the images which have been selected at previous iterations are excluded from later selections .For each query , the automatic relevance feedback mechanism is performed for four iterations .It is important to note that the automatic relevance feedback scheme used here is different from the ones described in 8 , 11 .In 8 , 11 , the top four relevant and irrelevant images were selected as the feedback images .However , this may not be practical .In real world image retrieval systems , it is possible that most of the top-ranked images are relevant or , irrelevant .Thus , it is difficult for the user to find both four relevant and irrelevant images .It is more reasonable for the users to provide feedback information only on the 10 images selected by the system .In real world , it is not practical to require the user to provide many rounds of feedbacks .The retrieval performance after the first two rounds of feedbacks especially the first round is more important .Figure 3 shows the average precision-scope curves of the different algorithms for the first two feedback iterations .At the beginning of retrieval , the Euclidean distances in the original 128-dimensional space are used to rank the images in database .After the user provides relevance feedbacks , the LRR , SVM , SVMactive , AOD , and LOD algorithms are then applied to re-rank the images .In order to reduce the time complexity of active learning algorithms , we did n't select the most informative images from the whole database but from the top 500 images .For LRR and SVM , the user is required to label the top 10 images .For SVMactive , AOD , and LOD , the user is required to label 10 most informative images selected by these algorithms .Note that , SVMactive can only be applied when the classifier is already built .Therefore , it can not be applied at the first round and we use the standard SVM to build the initial classifier .As can be seen , our LOD algorithm outperforms the other four algorithms on the entire scope .Also , the LRR algorithm performs better than SVM .This is because that the LRR algorithm makes efficient use of the unlabeled images by incorporating a locality preserving regularizer into the ordinary regression objective function .The AOD algorithm performs the worst .As the scope gets larger , the performance difference between these algorithms gets smaller .By iteratively adding the user 's feedbacks , the corresponding precision results at top 10 , top 20 , and top 30 of the five algorithms are respectively shown in Figure 4 .As can be seen , our LOD algorithm performs the best in all the cases and the LRR algorithm performs the second best .Both of these two algorithms make use of the unlabeled images .This shows that the unlabeled images are helpful for discovering the intrinsic geometrical structure of the image space and therefore enhance the retrieval performance .In real world , the user may not be willing to provide too many relevance feedbacks .Therefore , the retrieval performance at the first two rounds are especially important .As can be seen , our LOD algorithm achieves 6.8 % performance improvement for top 10 results , 5.2 % for top 20 results , and 4.1 % for top 30 results , comparing to the second best algorithm LRR after the first two rounds of relevance feedbacks .Several experiments on Corel database have been systematically performed .We would like to highlight several interesting points : 1 .It is clear that the use of active learning is beneficial in the image retrieval domain .There is a significant increase in performance from using the active learning methods .Especially , out of the three active learning methods SVMactive , AOD , LOD , our proposed LOD algorithm performs the best .2 .In many real world applications like relevance feedback image retrieval , there are generally two ways of reducing labor-intensive manual labeling task .One is active learning which selects the most informative samples to label , and the other is semi-supervised learning which makes use of the unlabeled samples to enhance the learning performance .Both of these two strategies have been studied extensively in the past 14 ,7 , 5 , 8 .The work presented in this paper is focused on active learning , but it also takes advantage of the recent progresses on semi-supervised learning 2 .Specifically , we incorporate a locality preserving regularizer into the standard regression framework and find the most informative samples with respect to the new objective function .In this way , the active learning and semi-supervised learning techniques are seamlessly unified for learning an optimal classifier .3 .The relevance feedback technique is crucial to image retrieval .For all the five algorithms , the retrieval performance improves with more feedbacks provided by the user .", "author_keywords_stem": ["imag retriev", "activ learn", "relev feedback"], "related work": "Since our proposed algorithm is based on regression framework .The most related work is optimal experimental design 1 , including A-Optimal Design , D-Optimal Design , and EOptimal Design .In this Section , we give a brief description of these approaches .The generic problem of active learning is the following .Given a set of points A = x1 , x2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xm in Rd , find a subset B = z1 , z2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , zk C A which contains the most informative points .In other words , the points zi i = 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , k can improve the classifier the most if they are labeled and used as training points .We consider a linear regression modelwhere y is the observation , x is the independent variable , w is the weight vector and ~ is an unknown error with zero mean .Different observations have errors that are independent , but with equal variances \u03c32 .We define f x = wT x to be the learner 's output given input x and the weight vector w. Suppose we have a set of labeled sample points z1 , y1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , zk , yk , where yi is the label of zi .Thus , the maximum likelihood estimate for the weight vector , \u02c6w , is that which minimizes the sum squared errorBy Gauss-Markov theorem , we know that w\u02c6 \u2212 w has a zero mean and a covariance matrix given by \u03c32H \u2212 1 sse , where Hsse is the Hessian of Jsse wwhere Z = z1 , z2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , zk .The three most common scalar measures of the size of the parameter covariance matrix in optimal experimental designSince the computation of the determinant and eigenvalues of a matrix is much more expensive than the computation of matrix trace , A-optimal design is more efficient than the other two .Some recent work on experimental design can be found in 6 , 16 ."}
