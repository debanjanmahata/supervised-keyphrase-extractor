{"abstract": "Reasoning about agents that we observe in the world is challenging .Our available information is often limited to observations of the agent 's external behavior in the past and present .To understand these actions , we need to deduce the agent 's internal state , which includes not only rational elements such as intentions and plans , but also emotive ones such as fear .In addition , we often want to predict the agent 's future actions , which are constrained not only by these inward characteristics , but also by the dynamics of the agent 's interaction with its environment .BEE Behavior Evolution and Extrapolation uses a faster-than-real-time agentbased model of the environment to characterize agents ' internal state by evolution against observed behavior , and then predict their future behavior , taking into account the dynamics of their interaction with the environment .", "id": "I-11", "conclusions": "In many domains , it is important to reason from an entity 's observed behavior to an estimate of its internal state , and then to extrapolate that estimate to predict the entity 's future behavior .BEE performs this task using a faster-than-real-time simulation of swarming agents , coordinated through digital pheromones .This simulation integrates knowledge of threat regions , a cognitive analysis of the agent 's beliefs , desires , and intentions , a model of the agent 's emotional disposition and state , and the dynamics of interactions with the environment .By evolving agents in this rich environment , we can fit their internal state to their observed behavior .In realistic wargames , the system successfully detects deliberately played emotions and makes reasonable predictions about the entities ' future behaviors .BEE can only model internal state variables that impact the agent 's external behavior .It can not fit variables that the agent does not manifest externally , since the basis for the evolutionary cycle is a comparison of the outward behavior of the simulated agent with that of the real entity .This limitation is serious if our purpose is to understand the entity 's internal state for its own sake .If our purpose of fitting agents is to predict their subsequent behavior , the limitation is much less serious .State variables that do not impact behavior , while invisible to a behavior-based analysis , are irrelevant to a behavioral prediction .The BEE architecture lends itself to extension in several promising directions .\u2022 The various inputs being integrated by the BEE are only an example of the kinds of information that can be handled .The basic principle of using a dynamical simulation to integrate a wide range of influences can be extended to other inputs as well , requiring much less additional engineering than other more traditional ways of reasoning about how different knowledge sources come together in impacting an agent 's behavior .those that have been distinguished by psychologists , and that might be useful for understanding and projecting behavior .We expect to extend the set of emotions and supporting dispositions that BEE can detect .\u2022 The mapping between an agent 's psychological cognitive and emotional state and its outward behavior is not one-to-one .Several different internal states might be consistent with a given observed behavior under one set of environmental conditions , but might yield distinct behaviors under other conditions .If the environment in the recent past is one that confounds such distinct internal states , we will be unable to distinguish them .As long as the environment stays in this state , our predictions will be accurate , whichever of the internal states we assign to the agent .If the environment then shifts to one under which the different internal states lead to different behaviors , using the previously chosen internal state will yield inaccurate predictions .One way to address these concerns is to probe the real world , perturbing it in ways that would stimulate distinct behaviors from entities whose psychological state is otherwise indistinguishable .Such probing is an important intelligence technique .BEE 's faster-than-real-time simulation may enable us to identify appropriate probing actions , greatly increasing the effectiveness of intelligence efforts .", "reader_keywords_stem": ["agent

we observe in the world must integrate two disparate levels .Our observations are often limited to the agent 's external behavior , which can frequently be summarized numerically as a trajectory in space-time perhaps punctuated by actions from a fairly limited vocabulary .However , this behavior is driven by the agent 's internal state , which in the case of a human may involve high-level psychological and cognitive concepts such as intentions and emotions .A central challenge inmany application domains is reasoning from external observations of agent behavior to an estimate of their internal state .Such reasoning is motivated by a desire to predict the agent 's behavior .This problem has traditionally been addressed under the rubric of `` plan recognition '' or `` plan inference . ''Work to date focuses almost entirely on recognizing the rational state as opposed to the emotional state of a single agent as opposed to an interacting community , and frequently takes advantage of explicit communications between agents as in managing conversational protocols .Many realistic problems deviate from these conditions .Domains that exhibit these constraints can often be characterized as adversarial , and include military combat , competitive business tactics , and multi-player computer games .BEE Behavioral Evolution and Extrapolation is a novel approach to recognizing the rational and emotional state of multiple interacting agents based solely on their behavior , without recourse to intentional communications from them .It is inspired by techniques used to predict the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems , in which a representation of the system is continually fit to its recent past behavior .For nonlinear dynamical systems , the representation is a closed-form mathematical equation .In BEE , it is a set of parameters governing the behavior of software agents representing the individuals being analyzed .The current version of BEE characterizes and predicts the behavior of agents representing soldiers engaged in urban combat 8 .Section 2 reviews relevant previous work .Section 3 describes the architecture of BEE .Section 4 reports results from experiments with the system .Section 5 concludes .Further details that can not be included here for the sake of space are available in an on-line technical report 16 .", "title": "Real-Time Agent Characterization and Prediction", "method": "BEE predicts the future by observing the emergent behavior of agents representing the entities of interest in a fine-grained agent simulation .Key elements of the BEE architecture include the model of an individual agent , the pheromone infrastructure through which agents interact , the information sources that guide them , and the overall evolutionary cycle that they execute .The agents in BEE are inspired by two bodies of work : our previous work on fine-grained agents that coordinate their actions through digital pheromones in a shared environment 2 , 13 , 17 , 18 , 21 , and the success of previous agentbased combat modeling .Digital pheromones are scalar variables that agents deposit and sense at their current locationear dynamical system .a = system state space ; b = system trajectory over time ; c = recent measurements of system state ; d = short-range prediction .in the environment .Agents respond to local concentrations of these variables tropistically , climbing or descending local gradients .Their movements change the deposit patterns .This feedback loop , together with processes of evaporation and propagation in the environment , support complex patterns of interaction and coordination among the agents 15 .Table 1 shows the BEE 's current pheromone flavors .For example , a living member of the adversary emits a RED-ALIVE pheromone , while roads emit a MOBILITY pheromone .Our soldier agents are inspired by EINSTein and MANA .EINSTein 6 represents an agent as a set of six weights , each in -1 , 1 , describing the agent 's response to six kinds of information .Four of these describe the number of alive friendly , alive enemy , injured friendly , and injured enemy troops within the agent 's sensor range .The other two weights relate to the agent 's distance to its own flag and that of the adversary , representing objectives that it seeks to protect and attack , respectively .A positive weight indicates attraction to the entity described by the weight , while a negative weight indicates repulsion .MANA 9 extends the concepts in EINSTein .Friendly and enemy flags are replaced by the waypoints pursued by each side .MANA includes low , medium , and high threat enemies .In addition , it defines a set of triggers e.g. , reaching a waypoint , being shot at , making contact with the enemy , being injured that shift the agent from one personality vector to another .A default state defines the personality vector when no trigger state is active .The personality vectors in MANA and EINSTein reflect both rational and emotive aspects of decision-making .The notion of being attracted or repelled by friendly or adversarial forces in various states of health is an important component of what we informally think of as emotion e.g. , fear , compassion , aggression , and the use of the term `` personality '' in both EINSTein and MANA suggests that the system designers are thinking anthropomorphically , though they do not use `` emotion '' to describe the effect they are trying to achieve .The notion of waypoints to which an agent is attracted reflects goal-oriented rationality .BEE uses an integrated rational-emotive personality model .A BEE agent 's rationality is a vector of seven desires , which are values in -1 , +1 : ProtectRed the adversary , ProtectBlue friendly forces , ProtectGreen civilians , ProtectKeySites , AvoidCombat , AvoidDetection , and Survive .Negative values reverse the sense suggested by the label .For example , a negativePheromone Description Flavor RedAlive Emitted by a living or dead entity of the appropriate group Red = enemy , Blue = friendly , Green = neutral RedCasualty BlueAlive BlueCasualty GreenAlive GreenCasualty WeaponsFire Emitted by a firing weapon KeySite Emitted by a site of particular importance to Red Cover Emitted by locations that afford cover from fire Mobility Emitted by roads and other structures that enhance agent mobility RedThreat Determined by external process see Section 3.3 BlueThreat value of ProtectRed indicates a desire to harm Red , and an agent with a high positive desire to ProtectRed will be attracted to REDALIVE , RED-CASUALTY , and MOBILITY pheromone , and will move at maximum speed .The emotive component of a BEE 's personality is based on the Ortony-Clore-Collins OCC framework 11 , and is described in detail elsewhere 12 .OCC define emotions as `` valanced reactions to agents , states , or events in the environment . ''This notion of reaction is captured in MANA 's trigger states .An important advance in BEE 's emotional model is the recognition that agents may differ in how sensitive they are to triggers .For example , threatening situations tend to stimulate the emotion of fear , but a given level of threat will produce more fear in a new recruit than in a seasoned veteran .Thus our model includes not only Emotions , but Dispositions .Each Emotion has a corresponding Disposition .Dispositions are relatively stable , and considered constant over the time horizon of a run of the BEE , while Emotions vary based on the agent 's disposition and the stimuli to which it is exposed .Interviews with military domain experts identified the two most crucial emotions for combat behavior as Anger with the corresponding disposition Irritability and Fear whose disposition is Cowardice .Table 2 shows which pheromones trigger which emotions .For example , RED-CASUALTY pheromone stimulates both Anger and Fear in a Red agent , but not in a Blue agent .Emotions are modeled as agent hormones internal pheromones that are augmented in the presence of the triggering environmental condition and evaporate over time .A non-zero emotion modifies the agent 's actions .Elevated level Anger increases movement likelihood , weapon firing likelihood , and tendency toward an exposed posture .Elevated Fear decreases these likelihoods .Figure 2 summarizes the BEE 's personality model .The left side is a straightforward BDI model we prefer the term `` goal '' to `` intention '' .The right side is the emotive component , where an appraisal of the agent 's beliefs , moderated by the disposition , leads to an emotion that in turn influences the BDI analysis .BEE 's major innovation is extending the nonlinear systems technique of Section 2.2 to agent behaviors .This section describes this process at a high level , then details the multi-page pheromone infrastructure that implements it .Figure 3 is an overview of Behavior Evolution and Extrapolation .Each active entity in the battlespace has an persistent avatar that continuously generates a stream of ghost agents representing itself .We call the combined modeling entity consisting of avatar and ghosts a polyagent 14 .Ghosts live on a timeline indexed by ti that begins in the past and runs into the future .ti is offset with respect to the current time t .The timeline is divided into discrete `` pages , '' each representing a successive value of ti .The avatar inserts the ghosts at the insertion horizon .In our current system , the insertion horizon is at ti t = -30 , meaning that ghosts are inserted into a page representing the state of the world 30 minutes ago .At the insertion horizon , each ghost 's behavioral parameters desires and dispositions are sampled from distributions to explore alternative personalities of the entity it represents .Each page between the insertion horizon and ti = t `` now '' records the historical state of the world at the point in the past to which it corresponds .As ghosts move from page to page , they interact with this past state , based on their behavioral parameters .These interactions mean that their fitness depends not just on their own actions , but also on the behaviors of the rest of the population , which is also evolving .Because ti advances faster than real time , eventually ti = t actual time .At this point , each ghost is evaluated based on its location compared with the actual location of its corresponding real-world entity .The fittest ghosts have three functions .Thus BEE has three distinct notions of time , all of which may be distinct from real-world time .ghosts move from one page to the next .The relation between shift time and real time depends on the processing resources available .BEE must operate very rapidly , to keep pace with the ongoing battle .Thus we use simple agents coordinated using pheromone mechanisms .We have described the basic dynamics of our pheromone infrastructure elsewhere 2 .This infrastructure runs on the nodes of a graph-structured environment in the case of BEE , a rectangular lattice .Each node maintains a scalar value for each flavor of pheromone , and provides three functions :The distribution of each pheromone flavor over the environment forms a field that represents some aspect of the state of the world at an instant in time .Each page of the timeline is a complete pheromone field for the world at the BEE time ti represented by that page .The behavior of the pheromones on each page depends on whether the page represents the past or the future .In pages representing the future ti > t , the usual pheromone mechanisms apply .Ghosts deposit pheromone each time they move to a new page , and pheromones evaporate and propagate from one page to the next .In pages representing the past ti < t , we have an observed state of the real world .This has two consequences for pheromone management .First , we can generate the pheromone fields directly from the observed locations of individual entities , so there is no need for the ghosts to make deposits .Second , we can adjust the pheromone intensities based on the changed locations of entities from page to page , so we do not need to evaporate or propagate the pheromones .Both of these simplifications reflect the fact that in our current system , we have complete knowledge of the past .When we introduce noise and uncertainty , we will probably need to introduce dynamic pheromones in the past as well as the future .Execution of the pheromone infrastructure proceeds on two time scales , running in separate threads .The first thread updates the book of pages each time the domain time advances past the next page boundary .At each step ,The second thread moves the ghosts from one page to the next , as fast as the processor allows .At each step ,executing the actions elected by the ghosts , and in future pages evaporating pheromones and recording new deposits from the recently arrived ghosts .Ghost movement based on pheromone gradients is a simple process , so this system can support realistic agent populations without excessive computer load .In our current system , each avatar generates eight ghosts per shift .Since there are about 50 entities in the battlespace about 20 units each of Red and Blue and about 5 of Green , we must support about 400 ghosts per page , or about 24000 over the entire book .How fast a processor do we need ?Let p be the real-time duration of a page in seconds .If each page represents 60 seconds of domain time , and we are replaying a simulation at 2x domain time , p = 30 .Let n be the number of pages between the insertion horizon and ti = t .In our current system , n = 30 .Then a shift rate of n/p shifts per second will permit ghosts to run from the insertion horizon to the current time at least once before a new page is generated .Empirically , this level is a lower bound for reasonable performance , and easily achievable on stock WinTel platforms .The flexibility of the BEE 's pheromone infrastructure permits the integration of numerous information sources as input to our characterizations of entity personalities and predictions of their future behavior .Our current system draws on three sources of information , but others can readily be added .Real-world observations .Observations from the real world are encoded into the pheromone field each increment of BEE time , as a new `` current page '' is generated .Table 1 identifies the entities that generate each flavor of pheromone .Statistical estimates of threat regions .Statistical techniques1 estimate the level of threat to each force Red or Blue , based on the topology of the battlefield and the known disposition of forces .For example , a broad open area with no cover is threatening , especially if the opposite force occupies its margins .The results of this process are posted to the pheromone pages as `` RedThreat '' pheromone representing a threat to red and `` BlueThreat '' pheromone representing a threat to Blue .AI-based plan recognition .While plan recognition is not sufficient for effective prediction , it is a valuable input .We dynamically configure a Bayes net based on heuristics to identify the likely goals that each entity may hold .2 The destinations of these goals function as `` virtual pheromones . ''Ghosts include their distance to such points in their action decisions , achieving the result of gradient following without the computational expense of maintaining a pheromone field .", "evaluation": "We have tested BEE in a series of experiments in which human wargamers make decisions that are played out in a battlefield simulator .The commander for each side Red and Blue has at his disposal a team of pucksters , human operators who set waypoints for individual units in the simulator .Each puckster is responsible for four to six units .The simulator moves the units , determines firing actions , and resolves the outcome of conflicts .It is important to emphasize that this simulator is simply a surrogate for a sensor feed from a real-world battlefieldTo test our ability to fit personalities based on behavior , one Red puckster responsible for four units is designated the `` emotional '' puckster .He selects two of his units to be cowardly `` chickens '' and two to be irritable `` Rambos '' .He does not disclose this assignment during the run .He moves each unit according to the commander 's orders until the unit encounters circumstances that would trigger the emotion associated with the unit 's disposition .Then he manipulates chickens as though they are fearful avoiding combat and moving away from Blue , and moves Rambos into combat as quickly as possible .Our software receives position reports on all units , every twenty seconds .1 This process , known as SAD Statistical Anomaly Detection , is developed by our colleagues Rafael Alonso , Hua Li , and John Asmuth at Sarnoff Corporation .Alonso and Li are now at SET Corporation .2 This process , known as KIP Knowledge-based Intention Projection , is developed by our colleagues Paul Nielsen , Jacob Crossman , and Rich Frederiksen at Soar Technology .The difference between the two disposition values Irritability Cowardice of the fittest ghosts proves a better indicator of the emotional state of the corresponding entity than either value by itself .Figure 4 shows the delta disposition for each of the eight fittest ghosts at each time step , plotted against the time in seconds , for a unit played as a chicken .The values clearly trend negative .Figure 5 shows a similar plot for a Rambo .Rambos tend to die early , and often do not give their ghosts enough time to evolve a ghosts vary in how likely they are , the risk they pose to their own or the opposite side , and so forth .In the experiments reported here , we select the future whose ghost receives the most guidance from pheromones in the environment at each step along the way .In this sense , it is the most likely future .In these experiments , we receive position reports only on units that have actually come within visual range of Blue units , or on average fewer than half of the live Red units at any time .We evaluate predictions spatially , comparing an entity 's acclear picture of their personality , but in this case the positive Delta Disposition is evident before the unit 's demise .To characterize a unit 's personality , we maintain a 800-second exponentially weighted moving average of the Delta Disposition , and declare the unit to be a chicken or Rambo if this value passes atual location with the location predicted for it 15 minutes earlier .We compare BEE with two baselines : a gametheoretic predictor based on linguistic geometry 22 , and estimates by military officers .In both cases , we use a CEP `` circular error probable '' measure of accuracy , the radius of the circle that one negative or positive threshold , respectively .Currently , this threshold is set at 0.25 .We are exploring additional filters .For example , a rapid rate of increase enhances the likelihood of calling a Rambo ; units that seek to avoid detection and avoid combat are more readily called chicken .Table 1 shows the detection results for emotional units in a recent series of experiments .We never called a Rambo a chicken .In the one case where we called a chicken a Rambo , logs show that in fact the unit was being played aggressively , rushing toward oncoming Blue forces .The brave die young , so we almost never detect units played intentionally as Rambos .Figure 6 shows a comparison on a separate series of experiments of our emotion detector compared with humans .Two cowards were played in each of eleven games .Human observers in each game were able to detect a total of 13 of the cowards .BEE was able to detect cowards = chickens much earlier than the human , while missing only one chicken that the humans detected .In addition to these results on units intentionally played as emotional , BEE sometimes detects other units as cowardly or brave .Analysis of these units shows that these characterizations were appropriate : units that flee in the face of enemy forces or weapons fire are detected as chickens , while those that stand their ground or rush the adversary are denominated as Rambos .Each ghost that runs into the future generates a possible path that its unit might follow .The paths in the resulting set over all would have to draw around each prediction to capture 50 % of the actual unit locations .The higher the CEP measure , the worse the accuracy .theoretic predictor is more accurate .In 18 RAID runs , BEE generated 1405 predictions at each of two time horizons 0 and 15 minutes , while in 18 non-RAID runs , staff generated 102 predictions .Figure .8 shows a box-andwhisker plot of the CEP measures , in meters , of these predictions .The box covers the inter-quartile range with a line at the median , whiskers extend to the most distant data points within 1.5 of the interquartile range from the edge of the box , squares show outliers within 3 interquartile ranges , and stars show more distant outliers .BEE 's median score even at 15 minutes is lower than either Staff median .The Wilcoxon test shows that the difference between the H15 scores is significant at the 99.76 % level , while that between the H0 scores is significant at more than 99.999 % .", "author_keywords_stem": ["plan recognit", "plan infer", "evolut", "predict", "emot", "bdi", "swarm intellig", "digit pheromon", "dynam"], "related work": "BEE bears comparison with previous research in AI plan recognition , Hidden Markov Models , and nonlinear dynamics systems trajectory prediction .Agent theory commonly describes an agent 's cognitive state in terms of its beliefs , desires , and intentions the so-called `` BDI '' model 5 , 20 .An agent 's beliefs are propositions about the state of the world that it considers true , based on its perceptions .Itsdesires are propositions about the world that it would like to be true .Desires are not necessarily consistent with one another : an agent might desire both to be rich and not to work at the same time .An agent 's intentions , or goals , are a subset of its desires that it has selected , based on its beliefs , to guide its future actions .Unlike desires , goals must be consistent with one another or at least believed to be consistent by the agent .An agent 's goals guide its actions .Thus one ought to be able to learn something about an agent 's goals by observing its past actions , and knowledge of the agent 's goals in turn enables conclusions about what the agent may do in the future .This process of reasoning from an agent 's actions to its goals is known as `` plan recognition '' or `` plan inference . ''This body of work surveyed recently at 3 is rich and varied .It covers both single-agent and multi-agent e.g. , robot soccer team plans , intentional vs. non-intentional actions , speech vs. non-speech behavior , adversarial vs. cooperative intent , complete vs. incomplete world knowledge , and correct vs. faulty plans , among other dimensions .Plan recognition is seldom pursued for its own sake .It usually supports a higher-level function .For example , in humancomputer interfaces , recognizing a user 's plan can enable the system to provide more appropriate information and options for user action .In a tutoring system , inferring the student 's plan is a first step to identifying buggy plans and providing appropriate remediation .In many cases , the higher-level function is predicting likely future actions by the entity whose plan is being inferred .We focus on plan recognition in support of prediction .An agent 's plan is a necessary input to a prediction of its future behavior , but hardly a sufficient one .At least two other influences , one internal and one external , need to be taken into account .The external influence is the dynamics of the environment , which may include other agents .The dynamics of the real world impose significant constraints .A rational analysis of an agent 's goals may enable us to predict what it will attempt , but any nontrivial plan with several steps will depend sensitively at each step to the reaction of the environment , and our prediction must take this reaction into account as well .Actual simulation of futures is one way the only one we know now to deal with the impact of environmental dynamics on an agent 's actions .Human agents are also subject to an internal influence .The agent 's emotional state can modulate its decision process and its focus of attention and thus its perception of the environment .In extreme cases , emotion can lead an agent to choose actions that from the standpoint of a logical analysis may appear irrational .Current work on plan recognition for prediction focuses on the rational plan , and does not take into account either external environmental influences or internal emotional biases .BEE integrates all three elements into its predictions .BEE is superficially similar to Hidden Markov Models HMM 's 19 .In both cases , the agent has hidden internal state the agent 's personality and observable state its outward behavior , and we wish to learn the hidden state from the observable state by evolution in BEE , by the Baum-Welch algorithm 1 in HMM 's and then predict the agent 's future behavior by extrapolation via ghosts in BEE , by the forward algorithm in HMM 's .BEE offers two important benefits over HMM 's .First , a single agent 's hidden variables do not satisfy the Markov property .That is , their values at t + 1 depend not only on their values at t , but also on the hidden variables of other agents .One could avoid this limitation by constructing a single HMM over the joint state space of all of the agents , but this approach is combinatorially prohibitive .BEE combines the efficiency of independently modeling individual agents with the reality of taking into account interactions among them .Second , Markov models assume that transition probabilities are stationary .This assumption is unrealistic in dynamic situations .BEE 's evolutionary process continually updates the agents ' personalities based on actual observations , and thus automatically accounts for changes in the agents ' personalities .Many systems of interest can be described by a vector of real numbers that changes as a function of time .The dimensions of the vector define the system 's state space .One typically analyzes such systems as vector differential equations , e.g. , When f is nonlinear , the system can be formally chaotic , and starting points arbitrarily close to one another can lead to trajectories that diverge exponentially rapidly .Long-range prediction of such a system is impossible .However , it is often useful to anticipate the system 's behavior a short distance into the future .A common technique is to fit a convenient functional form for f to the system 's trajectory in the recent past , then extrapolate this fit into the future Figure 1 , 7 .This process is repeated constantly , providing the user with a limited look-ahead .This approach is robust and widely applied , but requires systems that can efficiently be described with mathematical equations .BEE extends this approach to agent behaviors , which it fits to observed behavior using a genetic algorithm ."}
